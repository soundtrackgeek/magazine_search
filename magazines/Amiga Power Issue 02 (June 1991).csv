The page also includes a section on the game's controls and icons.

**Martin Beadle and Nick Gollop's Review:**

The review begins by describing the game as a 16-bit conversion of previous games by Julian Gollop, focusing on the features that combine elements of ""Chaos,"" ""Rebelstar,"" and ""Laser Squad.""  It highlights the game's strategy elements, emphasizing that it's closer to ""Laser Squad"" than ""Rebelstar.""  The review notes the player can control up to four characters.  The authors describe the gameplay as a slow, stop-start experience, with movement points limiting action and the menu system being unwieldy.  They mention the relative lack of action compared to other games, with the majority of combat being hand-to-hand.  The review also points out the game's orienteering-like feel, with a focus on exploration and treasure hunting rather than intense combat.  The authors praise the game's well-executed controls, clear graphics, and colorful presentation, but criticize the lack of ""chaos"" in the game's overall feel.  They conclude by saying the game is well-made but might not appeal to fans of fast-paced action games.

**Stuart Campbell's Review:**

Stuart Campbell's review gives a different perspective.  He expresses disappointment, stating that the game didn't live up to the expectations set by its predecessors.  He finds the game's lack of intense action and fast-paced combat to be a significant drawback.  Campbell highlights the game's depth but notes that it doesn't engage the player in a compelling way.  He describes the gameplay as more of an orienteering expedition than a strategic battle.  His overall assessment is that while the game isn't bad, it's not as exciting as he'd hoped.

**Game Controls and Icons Section:**

This section provides a detailed explanation of the game's various icons and their functions.  It explains how to use different commands, such as casting spells, using weapons, picking up items, and changing equipment.  The section also describes how to navigate the map, use different movement options (ground/air), and use the various potions and spells.  The icons are clearly labeled and illustrated, making it easy for the reader to understand their purpose.

**Overall:**

The page presents a balanced view of ""Lords of Chaos,"" highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses.  The two reviews offer contrasting perspectives, which is typical of a multi-reviewer approach.  The detailed description of the game's controls and icons is helpful for potential players.
