* **Question 2:** When's the game coming out? And do you have any plans to do it for the CD32?  The developers state the game is planned for early 1994 release, but express uncertainty about a CD32 version due to potential difficulties with save game functionality on consoles.

* **Question 3:** The game blurb boasts a special colour system – what's that all about, and won't it slow the game down? Does this mean that there won't be any need for an A1200 version?

The real war maps place the player in control of armies from various conflicts, including the Korean War, the Six-Day War, the Yom Kippur War, Vietnam, the Iran-Iraq War, and the Liberation of Kuwait.  A significant criticism is that the player can only control the ""good guys"" (Western-backed forces), which the reviewer feels significantly shortens the game's lifespan.

They mention the game's ""normal wibble"" (likely referring to the game's presentation or features) and the fact that they haven't played the original Campaign, making comparisons impossible.

* **Rating:** 5 stars
* **Summary:**  The review describes Madfighters 1200 as an excellent, AMOS-created clone of Street Fighter 2.  It's available in two versions: a cheaper PD version and a more extensive, full-featured, licenceware version.  The reviewer praises the game's fast-paced action, agile characters, and responsive controls, though acknowledging some minor sluggishness in certain instances.  The reviewer notes the 16 different fighters, each with unique moves, and the choice of Arcade or Knock-Out fight modes.  The reviewer also highlights the infinite credits in the full version.  The reviewer ultimately recommends the game, particularly the PD version, and encourages readers to check out the full version if they want more features.

**High Octane:**

* **Rating:** 5 stars
* **Summary:** This review discusses High Octane, a driving game with a sci-fi theme.  The reviewer notes that it's not a new game but has been enhanced and deserves recognition.  The reviewer highlights the game's impressive graphics, particularly the detailed skid marks left on the road when driving through mud or grass, and the engaging intro animation.  The reviewer also praises the game's speed and difficulty, noting the hazardous track conditions and the ability to shoot at opponents.  The reviewer concludes that, despite its limited scope compared to other games, High Octane is a solid driving game.

**Fingus the Bouncing Fungus:**

* **Reviewer:** Debra Gamgee
* **Rating:** Nothing (or a very negative rating implied)
* **Summary:** This review is extremely critical of Fingus the Bouncing Fungus.  The reviewer describes the game as virtually unplayable due to poor controls, a lack of progression in the levels, and a frustratingly difficult design.  The reviewer points out that the controls are inaccurate and make it nearly impossible to navigate the levels.  The game's graphics are described as uninspired, and the overall experience is deemed dull.
