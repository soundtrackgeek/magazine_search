However, the review also notes that the game's core gameplay mechanics are familiar and don't stray too far from the established Westwood formula.

The review details several key aspects of the game:

* **Setting:** The game takes place roughly 200 years before the 1984 film, in a universe where the Emperor has died, and the fate of the desert planet Arrakis (Dune) is in question.  The spice Melange, crucial for interstellar travel and extending human life, is a key element.

* **Gameplay:** The game features three main Houses (Atreides, Harkonnen, and Ordos) and several sub-houses, each with their own motivations and strategies.  Players can choose to play through campaigns for each House in any order.  The game includes 10-36 missions per campaign, with a total of 150 missions.  A strategic battlefield map is introduced, allowing players to strategically position their forces and bases.  The review emphasizes the importance of strategic considerations, such as the size of forces in surrounding areas, when planning attacks.

* **Units and Alliances:** The game features various units, including the Hawk Strike, which forces enemy units to retreat.  Reinforcements are influenced by the size of surrounding forces.  Alliances with factions like the Fremen (nomadic desert dwellers) provide access to unique units and abilities.  The review notes that these alliances are crucial to success but can be confusing for players unfamiliar with the Dune universe's political intricacies.

* **Interface:** The review describes the interface as a streamlined version of the tab system, making it more user-friendly.

* **Overall Impression:** The review concludes that ""Emperor: Battle for Dune"" is a solid RTS game that successfully blends familiar gameplay with new features and a visually appealing 3D presentation.  It's considered a strong entry in the genre.

The review also includes screenshots and graphics of the game's environments and units.  A small graphic of a sandworm is also present.  The page also includes the game's technical specifications, including required and recommended hardware.

53,"This page is a review of the PC game ""Emperor: Battle for Dune.""  The review, published in PC Gamer in August 2001, gives the game an 89% rating, calling it ""Excellent.""

The review is broken down into several sections:

**Initial Impressions and Gameplay:** The review begins by praising the game's impressive 3D engine, particularly its handling of large-scale destruction.  It then details the ease of use of the interface, highlighting features like queuing units, upgrading buildings, and setting waypoints.  The reviewer notes the use of FMV cutscenes and CG backdrops to tell the story.  The reviewer also comments on the acting quality.

**Story and Characters:** The review describes the story as ""pretty standard fare"" but notes some surprising plot points, such as a major House splitting.  However, the reviewer finds the final mission for all factions to be the same, which is a disappointment.  The units for each faction are well-designed and balanced, but the super-weapons are criticized as not being truly powerful, except for one.

**Multiplayer and AI:** The review discusses the two multiplayer modes (free-for-all and co-op) and the lack of a random map generator.  It praises the multiplayer experience, especially the ability to ally with sub-factions and access their unique weaponry.  The AI is described as having ""multiple personalities,"" sometimes acting as a perfect enemy, and other times being erratic, with units refusing to fight, getting stuck, or not acting strategically.

**Graphics and Performance:** The review highlights the game's smooth marriage of 3D graphics and real-time strategy gameplay.  The camera controls are praised for their ease of use, allowing for bird's-eye views.  However, the review also notes the game's high system requirements, stating that it performed well on a high-end machine (1.33GHz Thunderbird with GeForce2) but slowed down significantly on a lower-end machine (PIII 450 with TNT2).

**Overall Verdict:** The review concludes with a ""Final Verdict"" section, summarizing the game's strengths and weaknesses.  The positive aspects include great graphics, strategic map, and classic gameplay.  The negative aspects include steep system requirements, a somewhat flawed AI, and a somewhat repetitive final mission.  The review ultimately recommends the game as a must-have real-time strategy title for those with suitable hardware.

**Review Rating:** The review gives the game an 89% rating, signifying an excellent game.

56,"This page is a review of the video game ""Half-Life: Blue Shift,"" published in PC Gamer, August 2001.  The review is by Colin Williamson and gives the game a 64% rating, classifying it as ""above average.""

The review begins with a summary of the game's features and context.  It notes that ""Half-Life and its descendants have set the standard for online and off-line FPS excellence,"" and that Sierra's decision to release ""Blue Shift"" as a standalone product, rather than an expansion pack, is unusual.

The review then delves into the game's plot and gameplay.  It describes the protagonist as Barney Calhoun, a character from the ""Half-Life"" universe, and details the game's setting within the Black Mesa Research Base.  The reviewer highlights the game's polished map design, similar to the original ""Half-Life,"" and the inclusion of puzzles and a side-trip to the Border World of Xen.  The review also mentions the game's intense scripted sequences and scary Xen headcrabs.

The reviewer also discusses the game's graphical enhancements.  The ""High-Definition Pack"" is mentioned, which upgrades the monsters, NPCs, and weapons with higher-polygon models.  This upgrade is noted as applicable to both ""Half-Life"" and ""Opposing Force.""

However, the review criticizes the game's brevity, stating that it can be completed in a mere two and a half hours.  This is contrasted with the ""unacceptably high price"" of $34.95, making the game less worthwhile.  The reviewer also points out that the game doesn't introduce any new monsters or weapons, which is a significant drawback.

The review concludes with a ""Final Verdict"" section, summarizing the pros and cons.  The positive aspects include the fun gameplay, enhanced graphics, and inclusion of ""Half-Life: Opposing Force.""  The negative aspects are the short playtime and lack of new content.  The bottom line is that the game is only recommended if the player doesn't already own ""Opposing Force.""

**Fly! II Review:**

* **Rating:** 4.5% (Tolerable)
* **Summary:** The review criticizes Fly! II for numerous issues, including a lack of documentation, poor frame rates (especially for dial-up users), and a minimal collection of sectional charts and terrain scenery.  The reviewer notes that despite being marketed as a full-priced product, the game lacks a flight manual and key card.  The graphics are also criticized as poorly optimized, making the game run sluggishly.  While the game has some potential, the reviewer concludes that the numerous problems make it difficult to recommend.  The review highlights the game's potential to be the best chapter in the series if the issues were resolved.  The review also mentions the game's real-time weather, airframe damage, seamless multiplayer, and user-friendly scenery editor as positive aspects.

**Eurofighter Typhoon Review:**

* **Rating:** 73% (Good)
* **Summary:** The review for Eurofighter Typhoon is more positive, awarding it a 73% rating.  The reviewer praises the game's dynamic campaign, solid graphics, and impressive pyrotechnics.  The game's flight model is also noted as a strength, although the simplified handling and acceleration characteristics are mentioned as a potential drawback for hardcore sim enthusiasts.  The reviewer highlights the immersive war scenario set in Iceland in 2015, where players guide NATO pilots through a campaign against advancing Russian forces.  The visual presentation is also praised, with good aircraft renderings, although the lack of identifiable landmarks is noted.  The review also points out that the game is not suitable for older video cards.  The reviewer concludes that while not a revolutionary game, Eurofighter Typhoon is a valuable addition to the combat flight sim genre.

62,"This is a PC Gamer review of the video game ""Cossacks: European Wars,"" published in August 2001.

The review, written by William Harms, gives the game a 63% rating, classifying it as ""above average.""

**Review Summary:**

The review criticizes ""Cossacks: European Wars"" for being a derivative real-time strategy (RTS) game, essentially a clone of Age of Empires II.  While acknowledging decent graphics and large-scale battles, the reviewer highlights significant flaws.  The AI is described as ""horrible,"" with units frequently breaking formation and failing to act strategically.  The economic model is also problematic, requiring excessive manual micromanagement to maintain resources.  Annoying scripted missions and the overall lack of innovation are also mentioned.  The reviewer concludes that the game is a bland rehash of existing RTS mechanics, not justifying its price.

**Specific Sections of the Review:**

* **Introduction:** The review begins by stating that the game is a ""knockoff"" of Age of Empires II, highlighting the common trend of games borrowing features from predecessors.
* **Gameplay:** The review details the game's setting (pre-1800 Europe), missions (including historical conflicts), and units (infantry, cavalry, navy, artillery).  It notes the large number of upgrades available but emphasizes the lack of significant strategic differences between the various factions.  The reviewer points out the significant time spent on standard RTS activities like resource management and building.
* **Resource Management:**  A key criticism is the complex and frustrating resource management system.  The reviewer notes the manual nature of buying and selling resources, creating a ""micromanagement nightmare"" during large-scale conflicts.
* **AI:** The review strongly criticizes the artificial intelligence (AI) of the game.  The AI is described as poor, with units frequently breaking formation, getting trapped, and failing to act strategically.
* **Missions:** Some missions, like those involving negotiations and enemy-filled maps, are described as extremely frustrating due to the resource management and AI issues.
* **Graphics and Overall Impression:** While the graphics are deemed decent, the overall gameplay is criticized for being a simple amalgamation of other, better RTS games.  The reviewer concludes that the game lacks originality and fails to offer anything new or compelling.
* **Final Verdict:** The final verdict summarizes the review's key points, highlighting the decent graphics and unique resource management features as positives, but emphasizing the horrible AI, frustrating economic model, and annoying scripted missions as significant drawbacks.  The bottom line is that the game is a bland recycling of other RTS games and players should spend their money elsewhere.

**Carmageddon 3 Review:**

* **Rating:** 59% (Merely Okay)
* **Review Summary:**  The review criticizes Carmageddon 3's gameplay, describing it as ""offensively violent"" but lacking in polished mechanics.  The reviewer highlights the game's ""Bizarro Physics"" as a key element, but notes that the collision detection and damage models are unpredictable and frustrating.  Even the pedestrian-squashing aspect, a common feature of the series, is deemed difficult.  The reviewer also points out performance issues, noting that even on a decent system (Athlon 800 and Voodoo5), the frame rate struggled to maintain 30 fps.  The review concludes that the game is a mediocre addition to a series that's already considered second-rate, and that only those who enjoy the ""smooshing freaks"" aspect of the game will find it enjoyable.

**Off-Road Redneck Racing Review:**

* **Rating:** 78% (Good)
* **Review Summary:**  The review starts by acknowledging that the expectations for the game were low due to its low price point and the franchise's reputation.  However, the reviewer ultimately praises the game's design, calling it ""well-designed"" and ""a whole lot of fun.""  The reviewer highlights the game's success in capturing the essence of off-road racing, noting that it excels in its adolescent themes and basic elements.  The reviewer also praises the realistic physics engine, which accurately simulates driving on various terrains like mud and snow.  The graphics are also praised as mostly excellent, though the reviewer notes potential performance issues (processor hog) on less powerful systems.  The review concludes by recommending the game to racing fans, emphasizing that it's more than just a game for ""rednecks.""

**3D Prophet III:**  This card is the most expensive of the three at $429.  It deviates from the reference design in some aspects, most notably the color and shape of the cooling fan and the inclusion of a DVI-D-out for connecting a digital flat-panel display.  It also comes with a small S-video-to-composite adapter cable for use with TVs without S-video inputs.  Custom drivers are included.  The article mentions the game *Giants* is also included, but in a patched state.  The card also comes with PowerDVD software.

**Visiontek GeForce3:**  This card is priced at $399.  It's described as a ""no-frills"" card, focusing on the core GeForce3 reference design.  It includes a driver disc and a basic installation manual.  While performing similarly to the other two cards, it lacks additional software beyond the drivers, including no DVD-ROM software.

86,"This is an article from PC Gamer, August 2001, titled ""Time to Break the Rules.""  It's an opinion piece by Michael Wolf, discussing the state of the role-playing game (RPG) market and what needs to change for the genre to thrive.

The article opens with a general overview of the struggling games industry, particularly the RPG sector, in the wake of the dot-com crash.  It notes that profits are hard to come by, and many games are struggling to make a return on investment.  The author points out a trend of publishers prioritizing sequels and licensed titles based on popular movies, rather than investing in original, innovative RPGs.

The author argues that the current market climate, with publishers being cautious and risk-averse, is stifling innovation in the RPG genre.  They highlight Baldur's Gate as a successful example of an RPG that was released during a difficult time, but also point out that its success was partially due to dedicated support from Interplay.  The author suggests that the lack of such support for other RPGs might have led to their failure.

The article then discusses several specific examples of RPGs that have either succeeded or failed in the current market.  It mentions Neverwinter Nights, Black Isle's Torn, and Bethesda's Morrowind as examples of games that are trying to break the mold and cater to the desires of modders and players.  The author emphasizes the importance of supporting these types of innovative games.

The author concludes by arguing that the RPG genre needs to break the rules of the current market to survive.  They suggest that developers need to be more creative and innovative, and that publishers need to be more willing to take risks on new and original ideas.
