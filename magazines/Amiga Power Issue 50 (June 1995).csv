**Review of ""Desert Run"":**

The review begins with a detailed description of the game's plot and gameplay mechanics.  The reviewer highlights the ""followable story"" and clearly defined goals, contrasting it with other pinball games that might be more random.  The reviewer notes the stages involve shooting the petrol station to fuel the car, and qualifying for the next stage by reaching the center ramp.  There's also an alternative strategy of playing strategically to finish stages in pole position to earn an extra ball.  The reviewer praises the fast-paced gameplay, but also points out some flaws, such as the poorly-aimed balls in the mid-section and the frustratingly easy-to-miss targets.  The reviewer also mentions the combo time limits and the arrows, which are clearly visible.  A significant issue is the ball frequently falling into the outlane after hitting the pitstop ramp, which is considered a major flaw.  The review concludes with a 5-star rating for the game.

**Individual Pinball Game Rating:**

The game is given a 5-star rating.

**Uppers:**

This section highlights the positive aspects of the game.  Two tables are described as ""terrific,"" and a third as ""inoffensively playable.""  The reviewer praises the speedy gameplay and the ""lovely ideas"" behind the game's design.  The ability to rescue a lost ball is also mentioned as a positive feature.

**Downers:**

**The Bottom Line:**

The review concludes with a summary of the game's overall quality.  The reviewer finds the game fun and entertaining, but notes that it's somewhat flawed.  The game is compared to other pinball games, such as ""Pinball Dreams/Pinball Fantasies,"" and the reviewer notes that the game is not as polished as those titles.  The review also mentions a special A1200 version with extra tables and multiball, suggesting a potential improvement in future versions.  The review gives the game a 78% rating.
