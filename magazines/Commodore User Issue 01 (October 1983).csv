The title clearly states ""THE COMPLETE BEGINNERS GUIDE TO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING.""  The text is a step-by-step explanation, aimed at beginners, on how to write and run machine code programs on the VIC-20.

The content is organized into several distinct sections:

* **Introduction:** The introductory paragraph explains that this is the second in a series of articles designed to introduce users to 6502 assembly language programming on the VIC-20.  It emphasizes the use of a BASIC program to load the machine code into memory.

* **Example Program:** The section includes a BASIC program (lines 10-70) that, when run, will display the alphabet on the screen.  The code uses the `POKE` command to place data into memory locations.

* **6502 Registers:** This section details the different registers within the 6502 microprocessor, including the accumulator, index registers (X and Y), status register, stack pointer, program counter, and instruction register.  It also describes the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU).  The explanation is concise and focuses on the practical use of these registers in assembly language programming.

* **Locating Your Program:** This section explains how to reserve memory space for the machine code program, preventing it from being overwritten by BASIC.  It provides a specific example of using `POKE` commands to reserve memory space.

* **Program Objectives:** This section describes the goals of a sample program (the alphabet display).  It explains how the program will place specific characters and colors in designated memory locations on the screen.

The overall tone is instructional and practical, guiding the reader through the process of writing and running a machine code program.  The text is clear and concise, using simple language to explain complex concepts.  There's no explicit review rating, but the content is presented as a tutorial, not a review of a product.
"
35,"This page contains information about programming, specifically for a Commodore computer.  It details the steps involved in creating a program to display the alphabet.

**Diagram 1:** This is a flowchart illustrating the steps of the program.  The flowchart uses standard flowcharting symbols (rectangles, diamonds, etc.) to visually represent the sequence of operations.  The flowchart shows how the program loads a value into a register (X register), stores data at a specific memory address, decrements the register, and checks if the register has reached zero.  The process repeats until the register value is zero, at which point the program ends.  The text above the flowchart explains that the flowchart is important for understanding the program's logic, but some people might skip it.

**Program Coding:** This section explains the final step of the programming process: translating the flowchart into machine code.  It emphasizes the use of a reference guide or assembler to look up the machine code instructions corresponding to the steps in the flowchart.  The example given shows how to load a program from a BASIC program using DATA statements and a SYS command.

**Assembly Language:** This section explains that the machine code generated by the program is a series of numbers that are difficult to understand.  It highlights the use of assembly language mnemonics (three-letter codes) as a more readable alternative.  The text suggests that programmers can enter the assembly language instructions directly if they have a suitable assembler, or they can convert the assembly language into machine code.

**To Finish Off:** This section briefly discusses the status register and stack pointer, but promises to cover them in a later section.

**Diagram 2:** This is a table showing the machine code (in decimal, hexadecimal, and VIC-20 assembly language) for the alphabet program.  The table lists the address, contents (machine code), and the corresponding VIC-20 assembly instructions.  The table is organized with columns for decimal, hexadecimal, decimal contents, hexadecimal contents, and VIC-20 assembly instructions.  This table translates the flowchart into the specific machine code instructions that the computer will execute.

It highlights the packages' ability to streamline tasks like plotting points, drawing lines, and changing screen colors, which are often complex using lower-level commands like PEEKs and POKEs.

A key drawback mentioned is the packages' limited portability.  They are designed to work on specific hardware configurations (like the Commodore and Stack packages needing a minimum of 3K expansion, and working better with 8K or more), and therefore may not be usable on all Commodore machines.

The review details the different graphics modes available, including high-resolution and medium-resolution (multi-color) modes.  It explains how these modes affect the number of colors that can be displayed on the screen at once.  For example, high-resolution mode limits the colors to two per 8x16 pixel block, while medium-resolution allows four.  The review also describes how the packages handle plotting points and how the color of a plotted point affects the surrounding pixels in the same region.

The review also covers the different ways to acquire the packages, including as cartridges or EPROM chips, and the associated costs.  It mentions specific packages like the Commodore Super Expander and Stack VICIT III, and their respective prices and requirements.

The review also explains how the packages handle graphics commands, such as `GRAPHICS`, `CLEAR`, and `SCREEN`, and how these commands interact with the VIC-20's memory management.  It notes that the `GRAPHICS` command is crucial for high-resolution graphics and reconfigures the VIC-20's memory for this purpose.

The review concludes with a discussion of the color options available in each mode, and how the packages handle color settings.  It explains how the background color and character color can be different in different regions of the screen, and how the border and auxiliary colors work in the medium-resolution mode.
