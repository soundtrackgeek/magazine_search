19,"This page from a Commodore User magazine contains an article titled ""Controlling a Joystick the Easy Way.""  It details a machine code program, ""STick,"" designed to simplify reading joystick input from BASIC on a Commodore VIC-20.

The article explains that the program resides at memory location 673 and is activated by a `SYS 673` command.  Once running, it continuously monitors the joystick's position.  Crucially, the program modifies the system variable `ST` (Status) to create a new variable, `STICK`, which makes it easier for BASIC programs to interpret the joystick's input.

The article provides an example BASIC program (lines 10-80) that demonstrates how to use the `STick` program.  This example program uses `IF` statements to check which joystick buttons are pressed and prints corresponding messages (""UP,"" ""DOWN,"" ""LEFT,"" ""RIGHT,"" ""FIRE!"").  A `REM` statement (line 70) indicates a delay to prevent the program from running too quickly.

The article also includes a diagram showing the different joystick positions and their corresponding `STICK` values.  This allows programmers to translate the joystick's physical position into numerical values that can be used in BASIC code.

A separate section titled ""Program details"" lists the machine code data used by the `STick` program.  This section details the memory locations (100-160) and the actions performed by the machine code, including setting initial values, relocating the code, and checking for correct data entry.

The overall tone is instructional and practical, guiding the reader through the process of writing and running a machine code program.  The text is clear and concise, using simple language to explain complex concepts.  There's no explicit review rating, but the content is presented as a tutorial, not a review of a product.
"
35,"This page contains information about programming, specifically for a Commodore computer.  It details the steps involved in creating a program to display the alphabet.

**Diagram 1:** This is a flowchart illustrating the steps of the program.  The flowchart uses standard flowcharting symbols (rectangles, diamonds, etc.) to visually represent the sequence of operations.  The flowchart shows how the program loads a value into a register (X register), stores data at a specific memory address, decrements the register, and checks if the register has reached zero.  The process repeats until the register value is zero, at which point the program ends.  The text above the flowchart explains that the flowchart is important for understanding the program's logic, but some people might skip it.

**Program Coding:** This section explains the final step of the programming process: translating the flowchart into machine code.  It emphasizes the use of a reference guide or assembler to look up the machine code instructions corresponding to the steps in the flowchart.  The example given shows how to load a program from a BASIC program using DATA statements and a SYS command.

**Assembly Language:** This section explains that the machine code generated by the program is a series of numbers that are difficult to understand.  It highlights the use of assembly language mnemonics (three-letter codes) as a more readable alternative.  The text suggests that programmers can enter the assembly language instructions directly if they have a suitable assembler, or they can convert the assembly language into machine code.

**To Finish Off:** This section briefly discusses the status register and stack pointer, but promises to cover them in a later section.

**Diagram 2:** This is a table showing the machine code (in decimal, hexadecimal, and VIC-20 assembly language) for the alphabet program.  The table lists the address, contents (machine code), and the corresponding VIC-20 assembly instructions.  The table is organized with columns for decimal, hexadecimal, decimal contents, hexadecimal contents, and VIC-20 assembly instructions.
