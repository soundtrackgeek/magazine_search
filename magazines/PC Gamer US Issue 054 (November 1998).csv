Each act features unique environments and quests.  The first act takes place in a medieval town, the second in a desert, the third in a jungle, and the fourth is still under development.

* **Quests and Impact:**  The preview emphasizes the importance of quests, both main and sub-quests.  These quests have implications for the game world, including interactions with townspeople and changing prices for goods.

"
225,"This page is a review of the video game ""Independence War,"" published in PC Gamer in November 1998.

The review, written by Todd Vaughn, gives the game a 90% rating.

**Review Details:**

The review begins by describing the game's controls and interface.  The engineering section allows players to manage the ship's 35 vital systems, and the ship's control is described as remarkably responsive in some aspects (turning and rolling), but less so in others (forward momentum).  The game allows for both forward and rear-firing weapons, and the use of ripple fire allows for tracking and attacking multiple targets.  The various stations in the ship have specialized functions, and the weapons control area allows for maximum firepower.

The review highlights the game's missions as lively and memorable, with a good storyline.  The missions are described as challenging, with a quick ramp-up in difficulty.  The reviewer notes that the game's graphics are excellent, with vibrant colors and amazing textures, and the software renderer is nearly as good as hardware-accelerated games.  The in-game animations are also praised for their production value and attention to detail.

**Criticisms:**

Despite the positive aspects, the review points out some shortcomings.  The reviewer criticizes the lack of keyboard remapping, the unusual method of playing the opening cinematic (requiring an external Active Movie player), and some narrative inconsistencies where the narrative pieces fall behind the mission goals.  These issues, however, are not considered major flaws.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The review concludes that ""Independence War"" is a good, challenging space combat game, suitable for players who enjoy a more complex experience than a simple dogfighter.  The game's strong graphics, flight model, missions, and storyline are highlighted as key strengths.  The reviewer recommends the game to those looking for a challenging space epic."
226,"This page is a review of the video game ""Tiger Woods 99,"" published by EA Sports.  The review, written by Gary Whitta, appears in PC Gamer, November 1998.

**Game Overview:**

The review highlights the game's inclusion of Tiger Woods, a major draw for golf game fans.  EA Sports has made significant changes to the PGA Tour series to accommodate Woods' presence, including new features tailored to him.  The game features a new shot meter, and various ""Tiger Tips"" that pop up during gameplay.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

The review notes that the game's presentation is top-notch, with upbeat music replacing traditional golf game soundtracks.  However, the game's swing mechanic is criticized.  The traditional three-click swing meter is still present, but a new ""Pro Swing"" method using a mouse is also included.  The review points out that this new method is a concession to current trends in computer golf, but it's not as intuitive as the traditional method.  The review also notes that the swing isn't ""live"" like in other golf games; the player performs the swing on the meter, and only then does the golfer appear on screen to play out the shot.  This is considered less satisfying than other golf games.  The ability to choose between ""safe"" and ""aggressive"" shots is also highlighted as a new feature.

**Graphics and Performance:**

The review praises the game's graphics, calling them ""best-looking"" on faster systems.  However, the game's performance on slower systems is criticized.  The review states that the game runs smoothly on a 400MHz system with a Voodoo 2, but on a non-accelerated 166MHz system, the game still looks good but runs at a slower pace.  The review also notes that the game's claim of ""18 holes in 30 minutes"" is unrealistic.

**Multiplayer and Online Features:**

The review mentions the updated EA Sports Net service, which allows for online play with other players.  However, the review criticizes the online performance, noting that the time it takes to switch between players on a slower connection (28.8K modem) is too tedious.

**Overall Impression and Rating:**

The review concludes that ""Tiger Woods 99"" is a solid golf game, especially for faster systems.  However, the game's performance on lower-end PCs is subpar, and the analog swing method is considered inadequate.  The review gives the game an 84% rating.  The review also suggests that fans looking for a more intuitive and satisfying golf experience might want to wait for the ""Links LS 99"" game.

**Technical Specifications:**

The page also includes the required specifications for running the game, such as operating system, processor, RAM, and graphics card.  It also lists the multiplayer requirements, including the minimum and recommended modem speeds and network protocols.

**Safecracker Review:**

The review, written by Joseph Novicki for PC Gamer, gives Safecracker a 75% rating.  The review highlights both the positive and negative aspects of the game.

* **Positives:** The review praises the game's straightforward gameplay, easy pacing, and good puzzles.  It notes that the game is suitable for gamers of all skill levels, especially those who enjoy puzzle games.  The reviewer also appreciates the logical progression of the puzzles and the ability to pick up items to aid in solving them.

* **Negatives:** The review criticizes the inventory system, stating that it can become cluttered with items that are no longer needed.  A significant concern is that the game does not automatically include the contents of opened safes into the inventory, requiring the player to manually pick up items.

**Game Overview:**

The review highlights the game's tactical real-time action set during World War II.  It emphasizes the game's addictive nature, but also notes that it can be frustrating at times.  The game takes a page from classic World War II films, putting players in the role of a commander leading a team of six soldiers.  The goal is to disrupt enemy installations, eliminate enemy soldiers, and gather intelligence to aid the Allied forces.  The game focuses on smaller-scale engagements rather than large-scale battles.

**Gameplay Details:**

The review describes the game's interface as taking cues from real-time strategy games, allowing players to control individual soldiers or groups.  Players can access soldiers' weapons, tools, and special abilities through a knapsack interface or hotkeys.  The game features diverse environments, including deserts, forests, and snowy areas.  The review mentions the importance of each soldier's unique skills, such as sniping, demolitions, and driving.  However, the review also criticizes the game's lack of logic in some aspects, such as the limited abilities of individual soldiers (only one can drive, one can swim, etc.).  The review also points out that not all six soldiers are available for every mission.

**Technical Requirements:**

The page lists the minimum system requirements for running the game, including Windows 95, a specific CD-ROM drive speed, a minimum Pentium 120 processor, 16MB of RAM, and 125MB of hard drive space.  It also lists the recommended specifications, which include a Pentium 200 processor, 32MB of RAM, and supported sound card.

The review mentions that the game supports cooperative multiplayer via TCP/IP with a maximum of six players.  It provides a website address for the multiplayer service.

**Review Rating:**

The page does not explicitly state a numerical review rating.  However, the tone of the review suggests a mixed opinion, acknowledging both the game's strengths (addictive gameplay, diverse environments) and weaknesses (frustrating aspects, illogical elements).

**Additional Content:**

The page also includes a small image of the game's interface and a section with a brief description of a mission, along with a historical context.  There's also a short article about a historical event, the sinking of the Bismarck.  This article is presented in a format that looks like a separate article within the review.  Finally, the page includes a ""Before each mission"" section that describes the briefing screen that provides historical context for each mission.

The reviewer notes that the game's structure leans heavily on puzzle-solving, requiring players to use the right soldier at the right time in the right place to overcome obstacles.  The review also points out that the game's difficulty increases significantly after the first few missions, requiring careful planning and split-second timing.  The reviewer also mentions the use of WWII stock footage to introduce players to the war theaters.

The review also discusses the game's single-player mode, noting that it can be challenging and frustrating due to the difficulty of some missions.  However, the reviewer also acknowledges the game's engaging cooperative play against the computer, similar to ""Rainbow Six.""

The review gives the game a 68% rating.

**Review Summary:** The reviewer, Rob Smolka, acknowledges that the game has some strong points, particularly its arcade-style two-player action and the graphics.  However, the review criticizes several key aspects, including the poor artificial intelligence (AI) of the computer opponents, the frustrating lag in online play, and the lack of depth in the game's statistics and management features.  The online play, while advertised as a strong feature, is deemed problematic due to significant lag issues, even with a high-speed connection.  The reviewer concludes that while the game is decent for local multiplayer, it needs significant improvements to be a truly compelling experience, especially for online play.

**Specific Review Details:**

* **Graphics:** The reviewer praises the graphics as one of the game's strengths, noting well-rendered stadiums and detailed 3D players.

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The AI of the computer opponents is criticized for being poor, especially during the late stages of the game.
* **Statistics and Management:** The game's statistics tracking and management features are deemed poorly organized and insufficient for a simulation-style game.

* **Other Features:** The review mentions the draft feature, but criticizes its limitations.  The reviewer also notes issues with the game clock management and the inability to save progress during gameplay.

**Overall:** The review concludes that ""NFL Gameday 99"" is a decent action-oriented football game, but it needs significant improvements, particularly in its online play and AI, to be considered a truly compelling experience.  The reviewer suggests that the game may be more enjoyable for local multiplayer play.

263,"This page is a review of the video game ""Police Quest: SWAT 2,"" published by Sierra.  The review, appearing in *PC Gamer* magazine, is dated November 1998.

The review gives a detailed look at the game's features, gameplay, and shortcomings.  The reviewer's overall assessment is that while the game offers a ""real-life"" SWAT experience, it falls short of the intensity and depth expected.

**Review Rating:**  While not explicitly stated as a numerical rating, the tone of the review suggests a mixed or slightly negative opinion.  The reviewer highlights numerous flaws and issues with the game's interface and gameplay mechanics.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing the game's premise:  players take control of the LAPD's SWAT team, making decisions about equipment, training, and tactical operations.  The game is presented as a real-time strategy (RTS) game, placing the player in a variety of scenarios, from family disputes to terrorist bombings.

**Required Specifications:**

The page lists the minimum and recommended computer specifications needed to run the game, including operating system (Windows 95), processor speed (Pentium 133/200MHz), RAM (16/32MB), hard drive space (43.4/278MB), and video card capabilities (Super VGA with at least 4MB memory).

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

The review details the game's command panel, sub-windows (Gear and Command), and various tactical options, such as Crouch, Stealth/Dynamic movement, Challenge, Arrest, Rescue, Search, Disarm, Pick Up, Drop, Cover, and Entry.  The reviewer notes the importance of the ""Initiate"" button for issuing simultaneous commands to multiple units.

**Interface and Control Issues:**

The review criticizes the game's interface, particularly the difficulty in distinguishing perpetrators from innocent bystanders due to similar character models.  The reviewer also points out the game's unit control issues, noting that controlling officers via icons on two vertical bars is cumbersome and prone to errors.  The oblique perspective, while generally functional, is also criticized for causing character bunching and making it difficult to locate units.

**Strategic Depth and Gameplay:**

The review notes that the game's real-time strategy elements are present, but the tactical interface has significant problems.  The reviewer highlights the difficulty in managing resources and the complexities of the game's monetary system.  The reviewer also mentions the game's ""Sort"" function as a helpful tool for managing officers, but notes that the game's monetary system can be challenging to manage.

**Overall Impression:**

The review concludes that despite the game's real-life setting and emphasis on saving lives, numerous flaws in the interface and control mechanisms prevent it from being a compelling experience.  The reviewer highlights the difficulty in controlling units, the interface glitches, and the challenges of managing resources as significant shortcomings.

**Technical Details:**

The page includes screenshots of the game's interface, showing the in-game environment and the various elements of the game.  The screenshots illustrate the game's perspective, character models, and the command panel.  The review also includes a link to the game developer's website.

264,"This page is a review of the video game SWAT 2, published in PC Gamer magazine in November 1998.

The review is a lengthy critique, giving a detailed breakdown of the game's strengths and weaknesses.  The overall rating given is 52%.

**Review Sections:**

* **Interface and Gameplay:** The reviewer criticizes the game's interface as ""clumsy and confusing.""  Specific issues highlighted include the difficulty in coordinating movement and actions of multiple officers, the lack of a clear distinction between movement and firing, and the cumbersome cover command system that only affects one officer at a time.  The Stealth/Dynamic movement button is also criticized for not always functioning as expected when switching officers.

* **Mission Design and Story:** The reviewer notes that while some terrorist missions start with non-violent intentions, the arrival of the police almost always leads to gunplay.  The reviewer feels this aspect of the game is not particularly engaging.

* **Interface Glitches and Other Oddities:** The review points out numerous interface issues beyond the core gameplay mechanics.

While praising the game's attractive graphics, good controls, and decent track selection, the reviewer criticizes the game's easy tracks, easy opponents, and limited replay value.  The reviewer concludes that the game is fun and energetic, but ultimately lacks depth and substance, leaving players wanting more.

**Game Details:**

* **Category:** Arcade
* **Developer:** Criterion
* **Publisher:** Ubisoft Entertainment
* **System Requirements:** Win95, 4x CD drive, Pentium 133 (with Voodoo Graphics accelerator or equivalent), Pentium 166 (other supported chipsets), 16MB RAM, and a supported sound card.  Recommended specs include Pentium II, 64MB RAM, Voodoo or Voodoo II accelerator, and a joystick.

The review begins by highlighting the game's fast-paced, arcade-style motorcycle racing action.  It notes that the game's handling is good, but not affected by the environment (e.g., icy roads).  The review then delves into the game's strengths and weaknesses:

* **Graphics and Presentation:** The graphics are described as nicely detailed, with colorful scenery and attractive presentation.  The bikes and riders are well-rendered.
* **Gameplay:** The game focuses on fast crotch rockets and tight, twisty courses.  The reviewer notes that the game is easy to pick up and play, but the tracks are too easy and the AI opponents are not challenging.  The game's handling is praised, but the lack of course-bike matching is a significant drawback.  The reviewer also points out that the game's artificial intelligence opponents don't pose much of a challenge, except when they happen to get in the player's way.
* **Multiplayer:** The game's multiplayer support is described as robust, allowing up to eight players.  However, the reviewer notes that the easy tracks can lead to repetitive gameplay even in multiplayer.

* **Difficulty:** The game's difficulty is described as easy, with the tracks being forgiving of mistakes.  The reviewer notes that the game doesn't require much skill to complete.
* **Overall Impression:** The review concludes that while the game is fun and energetic, its easy tracks, easy opponents, and limited replay value will likely disappoint players looking for a more substantial racing experience.

**Game Overview:**

The game takes place on a 3D planet, reminiscent of Tolkien or H.G. Wells, with snow-capped mountains and futuristic cityscapes.  A key element is the need to gather ""floatstone"" to build and maintain units.

There are over 60 specialized units, categorized into six types (command towers, attack weaponry, defensive structures, energy supplies, maneuvering jets, and TechnoMage units).  Balancing these units and managing their energy needs is crucial.  The game also involves ground targets, which are important for gaining an advantage.  The game features a ""Unit Library"" with detailed descriptions, 3D pictures, and statistical breakdowns of each unit, which is considered a helpful tool.

285,"This page is a review of the video game ""Industry Giant,"" published in PC Gamer magazine in November 1998.

The review, written by Joseph Novicki, gives the game a final verdict score of 58%.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing ""Industry Giant"" as a strategy game that blends elements of capitalism and transport tycoon games.  The player's goal is to manage resources, build infrastructure (like transportation networks and factories), and grow a city while competing against other players.  The game's isometric view is similar to SimCity 2000 and Transport Tycoon.

**Positive Aspects:**

The reviewer notes the game is enjoyable to watch as the player's city grows and develops.

**Negative Aspects:**

The reviewer criticizes the game's lack of originality, stating that it relies heavily on existing concepts from similar games.  The reviewer also points out that keeping track of transportation networks becomes tedious and repetitive.  The economic simulation aspect is also criticized as being limited, with the player unable to fully control resource ownership and supply/demand.

**Technical Details:**

The review mentions the game's requirements, including Windows 95, a quad-speed CD-ROM drive, a Pentium 90 processor, 16MB of RAM, and a mouse.  The game supports Super VGA graphics with resolutions up to 1024x768.

**Comparison to Other Games:**

The review explicitly compares ""Industry Giant"" to ""Transport Tycoon"" and ""SimCity 2000,"" highlighting the similarities in gameplay mechanics and visual style.

**Overall Impression:**

The review concludes that while the game presents an interesting concept, its execution falls short of expectations due to its reliance on existing mechanics and lack of depth in its economic simulation.  The reviewer finds the game too basic and sterile to be truly compelling.

286,"This page is a PC Gamer review of the video game ""Emergency: Fighters for Life.""

**Game Overview:**

The review describes ""Emergency: Fighters for Life"" as a real-time strategy (RTS) search-and-rescue game, focusing on fire-fighting and emergency medical services.  The game features a variety of vehicles (fire trucks, ambulances, helicopters) and personnel (firefighters, doctors).  Players must respond to accidents, fires, and other emergencies, coordinating their teams to save victims.

**Review Rating:**

The game receives a 45% rating.

**Positive Aspects (HIGHS):**

The review highlights the game's potential for ""life-saving goodness"" and the variety of missions.

**Negative Aspects (LOWS):**

The review criticizes the game's confusing gameplay, particularly the poor artificial intelligence (AI) of the characters.  The AI is described as ""idiotic,"" causing problems with pathfinding, vehicle movement, and overall coordination.  The interface is also called ""clunky,"" and the procedures for handling emergencies are described as ""puzzles"" that can lead to instant death if not handled correctly.  The review also notes that the game's time limits are forgiving, but the procedures are not.

**Gameplay Details:**

The review details the game's mechanics, including the initial FMV (full-motion video) sequences that set up each mission, the need to equip and dispatch vehicles, and the overhead map.  It emphasizes the frustrating aspects of the game, such as units getting stuck in hallways, firefighters forgetting to use extinguishers, and vehicles driving in circles.  The review also points out the game's tendency to make the player micro-manage every unit, leading to chaos if not done correctly.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The review concludes that while the concept of the game is solid, ""Emergency: Fighters for Life"" is ultimately a ""half-baked RTS game"" due to its significant flaws in gameplay, AI, and interface.  The review suggests that the game's potential is not realized due to these issues.

**Additional Notes:**

The review also mentions the use of a ""Dukes of Hazzard"" style AI in some situations, which is criticized as inappropriate for the game's context.  The review also includes a quote from the reviewer, Colin Williamson, summarizing the game's shortcomings.  Finally, the page includes a table with the game's system requirements.

307,"This page is a review of the Quantum Obsidian X-24 3D accelerator card, published in PC Gamer in November 1998.

The review is presented in a standard magazine layout, with a large headline highlighting the product and a brief summary of the review's findings.

**Product Overview:**

The review details the Quantum Obsidian X-24, a 3D accelerator card that uses two Voodoo2 chipsets in scan-line interleave (SLI) mode.  It's positioned as an affordable alternative to more expensive workstation-class cards, offering similar performance to two separate Voodoo2 cards.  The card is notable for its ability to output to a TV, a feature not common in all cards at the time.

**Price and Performance:**

The card retails for $599.  The review notes that while the card's performance is good, it's not as fast as two separate Voodoo2 cards in SLI mode, especially when considering the price.  The review also points out a limitation: the refresh rate is capped at 85Hz, which affects benchmark results.

**Benchmark Results:**

The review includes benchmark results for several popular games, including Forsaken and Quake II, at various resolutions.  The results are presented in tables, showing frame rates.  The review notes that the results are affected by the 85Hz refresh rate limitation.  The review also mentions that the vertical synchronization (V-Sync) setting was tested both on and off, and the results show that turning off V-Sync improves frame rates but degrades image quality.

**Comparison to Competitors:**

The review compares the X-24 to other similar cards, highlighting its price point and single PCI slot advantage.  It also discusses the ease of connecting two separate Voodoo2 cards in SLI mode, which is a more expensive but potentially higher-performance option.

**Technical Details:**

The review provides details about the card's technical specifications, including the use of two Voodoo2 chipsets and the SLI mode.  It also mentions the card's TV output capability.

**Overall Review and Conclusion:**

The review concludes that the Quantum Obsidian X-24 is a decent card, but its high price and limited refresh rate are drawbacks.  The review recommends the card only if the user needs the single PCI slot and TV output features, and can't afford or doesn't have the space for two separate cards.  The final verdict gives the card a mixed rating, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses.

**Rating:**

The review does not explicitly state a numerical rating, but the overall tone suggests a mixed or slightly negative opinion due to the price and limitations.

310,"This is a review of the Monsoon MM-1000 speaker system, published in PC Gamer in November 1998.

The review is structured as follows:

**Product Overview:** The review begins by describing the Monsoon MM-1000 as a three-piece speaker system designed for multimedia use, specifically gaming.  It notes the unusual design, jumping from the automotive audio market to the gaming market.  The system's 50-watt output (12.5 watts per satellite, 25 watts for the subwoofer) is mentioned.  The reviewer highlights the unusual placement of controls, all on the subwoofer, and the inclusion of a wired remote control for convenience.

**Design and Features:** The review details the unique design of the satellite speakers.  Instead of traditional cone-shaped speakers, the MM-1000 uses planar dipoles, thin mylar film sheets with conductive strips that react to magnetic fields from the sound card.  This design is intended to create a wider, more immersive ""3D"" sound field, projecting sound both forward and backward.  The review also notes the importance of speaker placement for achieving the intended effect, as poor placement can reduce the perceived depth.

**Sound Quality:** The review is critical of the sound quality.  While the speakers create a wide soundstage, the midrange frequencies are described as ""tinny"" and lacking in quality.  The review attributes this to either the planar dipole design or a design flaw in the system.  The subwoofer, while present, is not enough to compensate for the midrange deficiency.

**Performance Comparison:** The review compares the MM-1000 to standard PC speakers, noting a significant difference in the perceived soundstage and depth.  The MM-1000's sound is described as impressive in terms of creating a wide sound field, but the quality is lacking.

**Overall Assessment:** The review concludes with a mixed assessment.  The unique planar dipole design is praised for its aesthetic appeal and ability to create a wide soundstage.  However, the sub-par sound quality, particularly the lack of midrange, is a significant drawback.  The $229 price point is also criticized, as it places the speakers in the same price range as more capable and higher-quality speakers from Cambridge SoundWorks.  The review ultimately concludes that the MM-1000 serves more as a demonstration of technology than a practical gaming speaker system.

**Rating:** The review includes a ""PC Gamer Final Verdict"" section with a rating.  The rating is split into ""Highs"" and ""Lows,"" highlighting the positive and negative aspects of the product.  The ""Bottom Line"" summarizes the overall opinion of the product.  The rating is not explicitly stated as a numerical score, but the overall tone of the review is negative, with more emphasis on the shortcomings than the strengths.

* **Defending Against Room Clearing:**  This section advises on how to defend against an enemy clearing a room.  The key is to avoid being trapped in a room with only one exit.

**Mission 6: Destroying the Bridges**

The guide advises against destroying the base's defenses, as they will be needed for defense once the base is captured.  The strategy involves heading south to eliminate a group of Commandos, then moving north-northwest past the base and along a road that cuts in front of it.  The guide emphasizes avoiding the base's turrets and control buildings initially.  The strategy involves destroying Bulldog tanks and their heavy autocannons, then destroying the bridges they are guarding.  The guide then instructs players to return to the base, capture the Turret Control Building and Sensor Control Building, and capture the HQ building to officially capture the base.  The guide also emphasizes the importance of maneuvering to avoid enemy units closing in on the base from multiple directions.  It also advises players to use the Tactical Map to anticipate enemy movements and position their forces accordingly.

**OP2 - Mission 6**

This section provides additional context for Mission 6, highlighting the importance of speed and firepower, and recommending a mix of both.  It also notes that the Jaguars are already sending reinforcements to the base, meaning the player will need to defend the base after capturing it.  The guide emphasizes the importance of long-range weapons for defense.

The strategy guides are well-organized, using clear language and visual aids (screenshots of the game).  The layout is typical of a game strategy guide in a magazine.
