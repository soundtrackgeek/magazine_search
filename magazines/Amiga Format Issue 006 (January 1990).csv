75,"This page is a review of the video game ""Toobin',"" published in *Amiga Format* magazine, issue 75.  The review, written by Bob Wade, gives the game an overall rating of 72%.

The review is presented in a format typical of a magazine game review, with various sections discussing different aspects of the game.

**Game Overview:** The game features two characters, Biff and Jet, paddling in inner tubes down various rivers.  The rivers are depicted with different obstacles and hazards, including icebergs, penguins, sewage, mines, skulls, bushes, logs, rocks, fishermen, eskimos, sphinxes, and punks.  The game also includes sections of rapids and waterfalls.  The gameplay involves navigating these obstacles while avoiding dangers and collecting items like cans, beach balls, and patches.

**Gameplay Mechanics:** The review highlights the somewhat awkward but ultimately enjoyable tube control system.  Moving the tube left or right spins it in that direction, and moving both sticks together propels the tube forward.  The game includes various sections with different hazards, such as icebergs, penguins, sewage, mines, and skulls.  The game also features a limited supply of cans that can be used to remove or freeze obstacles.

**Graphics and Sound:** The graphics are described as not overly impressive, with small character details, but the animated tube-dudes are highlighted as a positive aspect. The sound is described as mostly cheery and happy, fitting the game's atmosphere, with eerie music for the Mars and swamp sections.

**Judgment:** The review notes that the tube controls are initially tricky to master, but the unusual nature and responsiveness of the controls make the game enjoyable in the long run.  The simple gameplay is initially fun, but the lack of significant depth is mentioned as a potential drawback.  The two-player mode is highlighted as more engaging due to the competition for bonuses and bouncing around.

**Specific Game Elements:**  The review mentions various game elements, including:

* **On Mars:**  The presence of cans, patches, and a gun turret as obstacles.
* **Waterfalls and Waterfalls:**  The automatic movement through these elements.
* **Alligators:**  A constant threat that pursues the characters.
* **Patches:**  Used up each time something punctures the tube.
* **Beach Balls:**  Enhance control over the tube.
* **Treasure Chests:**  Items to be collected.
* **Shooting Bushes:**  Reveal objects or letters.
* **Sinking:**  A potential hazard from alligators, boulders, or bushes.
* **Hippo:**  A character that paddles past.
* **Tin Can:**  An object that can take out a bush.

**Technical Specifications:** The game is listed as being available for the Amiga computer, and the price is £19.99.  The review also mentions the use of a joystick or keyboard for control.

**Rating Breakdown:** The review provides a breakdown of the game's different aspects, including graphics (5/10), sound (8/10), intellect (2/10), addiction (7/10), and an overall score of 72%.
