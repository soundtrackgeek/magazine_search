**Gameplay Description:**

The review describes the game's plot, which involves a 50-year-old conflict between two nations, culminating in the death of the king and the need for his son to defeat an evil wizard, Zandor, to retrieve an antidote.  The player, as Edred The Brave, must navigate six levels, encountering various obstacles and enemies, including a dragon, a monster guarding Zandor, and various other creatures.  The levels involve navigating tunnels, underground rivers, and corridors.  The review notes that the first level is slow, and the later levels become repetitive.

**Graphics and Sound:**

The graphics are described as generally good, with impressive dragons and smooth animation.  However, the tunnel scrolling is considered poor.  The sound is praised as even better than the graphics, with convincing footfalls and a good tune.

**Judgment:**

The review criticizes the gameplay, stating that while the visuals and sound are good, the content of the levels is lacking, particularly after the first few levels.  The reviewer notes that the fourth level is almost identical to the third, which reduces the game's replayability.  The review concludes that the game's presentation is good, but the gameplay is not as engaging as it could be, especially for those who prioritize gameplay over visuals.

**Specific Game Elements:**

The review highlights specific game elements, such as the blue monster guarding Zandor, the corridor of death, the dragon Olisos, and the underground river.  It also mentions the need to collect the antidote and the importance of avoiding obstacles like rocks and stalactites.

**Rating and Conclusion:**

The overall rating of 53% reflects a mixed opinion.  While the graphics and sound are considered strong points, the repetitive gameplay and lack of content in later levels are significant drawbacks.  The review suggests that the game might be more enjoyable for players who prioritize the visual presentation over the gameplay experience.

67,"This page is a review of the Videon video digitizer, and a separate review of the Digi-View Gold video digitizer.  Both are aimed at Amiga users.

**Videon Review:**

The review gives a mixed assessment of the Videon digitizer.  The reviewer starts by stating that the product doesn't live up to its hype, particularly regarding its ability to capture video from standard sources.  It's described as capable of capturing still images from video cameras and still subjects, but not from video recorders in real-time.  The reviewer notes that the image capture process takes at least 30 seconds to build a recognizable image.

The review highlights a positive aspect: the software's ability to manipulate the captured image.  It allows for various effects like altering contrast, brightness, and color levels, applying mosaic, solar, multiple, zoom, and threshold effects, and converting images to negative.  The software also supports various Amiga modes, including high resolution, interlace, halfbrite, HAM, and overscan.  Two digitizing speeds are available: fast and slow scan.  The reviewer notes that the fast scan takes 30-60 seconds to produce an image and is memory-intensive, while the slow scan is slower but doesn't require extra memory.  The software can wrap a digitised image around a solid shape, creating 3D effects.

However, the review criticizes the manual, calling it ""naff"" and worse than other products' manuals.  It also notes that the packaging contains more information than the manual itself.

**Digi-View Gold Review:**

This section reviews the Digi-View Gold, a different product.  The reviewer praises the compact size of the digitizer, describing it as smaller than a cigarette packet.  The reviewer emphasizes the combination of hardware and software, enabling high-quality color or monochrome image transfer from a video camera to an Amiga.

The article provides a visual representation of the waveform changes.

**Additive Synthesis:** This section contrasts with subtractive synthesis, explaining how additive synthesis builds complex sounds by combining simpler waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth, ramp).  It discusses the use of Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs) to create effects like vibrato and tremolo, and how LFOs can also be used to create new pitches through frequency modulation.  The article highlights Yamaha's contributions to this technique.

**Voicing Software:** This section discusses the limitations of using computers for music creation, particularly the Amiga's internal sound chip.  It explains that while computers can be used for music creation, they often require dedicated sound cards or software to achieve the desired results.  The article emphasizes the complexity of creating and tweaking sounds on computers with limited graphical interfaces.

**General Information:** The article also includes a brief introduction to various digital synthesis techniques, mentioning a wide range of methods like Frequency Modulation, Cross Wave, and others.

145,"This page is an article review of ArgAsm, a new assembler for the Amiga computer system.  The author, Jason Holborn, highlights the promises of ArgAsm as a faster and more powerful assembler than existing options.

**Review Title:** THE NEED FOR SPEED

**Review Content:**

The article opens by acknowledging that assemblers are typically not exciting, but ArgAsm is presented as a notable exception.  The review then delves into several key aspects of ArgAsm:

* **Speed:** The review emphasizes ArgAsm's speed as a primary selling point, contrasting it with the perceived slowness of other Amiga assemblers.  This speed is attributed to a single-pass assembly process, which directly assembles source code into object code, resolving forward references as it goes.  This is contrasted with the two-pass approach of other assemblers.

* **Features:** ArgAsm's integrated editor, ArgEd, is described as a powerful multi-window editor allowing simultaneous work on multiple source files.  Key features mentioned include:
    * **Multiple windows:**  The ability to work on multiple source files simultaneously.
    * **Configurable attributes:**  Customization options for tab sizes, text buffer size, file backups, and auto-indenting.
    * **Preference menu:**  A menu for setting and saving preferences.
    * **Snapshot facility:**  A feature for capturing screen images, which is highlighted as a useful tool for debugging.
    * **Number base converter and calculator:**  Built-in tools for converting between number systems and performing calculations.

* **Comparison to Devpac:** The review compares ArgAsm to Devpac, another popular Amiga assembler.  It notes that ArgAsm is a multiple-window editor, unlike Devpac's single-window approach.

* **Close to the Edit:** ArgAsm's integrated editor/assembler suite is described as a collection of tools for creating assembler programs.  The review mentions two versions: a command-line interface (CLI) version (Arg) and a Devpac-like integrated editor (ArgEd).

* **Multiple Versions:** The review points out that ArgAsm comes in two versions: one integrated into the editor (ArgEd) and a separate command-line version.

* **Source Compatibility:**  ArgAsm is presented as source-compatible with other assemblers, including HiSoft's Devpac, Inovatronic's CAPE, and Metacomco's ASSEM.  However, compatibility with Kuma's K-SEKA is noted as lacking due to SEKA's non-standard code format.

* **Performance:** The review highlights the speed improvements of ArgAsm, particularly when handling large source code files.  Throughput figures are mentioned.

**Overall Impression:**

The review presents ArgAsm as a significant advancement in Amiga assemblers, emphasizing its speed, powerful features, and source compatibility with other systems.  The author highlights the speed and ease of use of the integrated editor, ArgEd, as key advantages.  The review also acknowledges some limitations, such as the lack of a built-in debugger and the need for a separate purchase.

**Rating:**

No explicit rating is given, but the tone of the review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting ArgAsm's strengths and improvements over existing tools.

It emphasizes the speed of the assembler, comparing it favorably to competitors like Devpac.  The review notes ArgAsm's compatibility with other Amiga assemblers, allowing users to import code from other systems.  It also discusses the ability to use the command-line interface (CLI) for assembly, which is a feature appreciated by users who prefer a more direct approach.  The review also mentions the ability to control assembly tasks, such as pulling binary data into programs, and conditional assembly.  A key point is the speed advantage over competitors, sometimes exceeding seven times faster.

* **Conclusion:**  The conclusion section summarizes the review's findings, emphasizing ArgAsm's speed, compatibility, and overall value.  It addresses the potential concern of needing to use a separate editor by stating that ArgAsm can work with other editors.  The review also highlights the software's ability to handle complex code efficiently.  It also mentions the software's compatibility with existing assemblers, which is a significant selling point.  The conclusion also mentions the software's potential for future upgrades and the availability of a professional version.
