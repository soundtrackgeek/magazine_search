Another shows the island's layout and buildings.  The review details the two primary gameplay modes: ready-made scenarios and open-ended gameplay.

It highlights the impressive graphics, particularly the detailed ship models, and the rich, detailed battles.  The reviewer notes the game's non-linearity, allowing players significant freedom in their choices.

However, the review also points out some drawbacks.  The game requires numerous patches to fix bugs and inconsistencies, which can be a significant time investment.

* **Developer:** Akella
* **Publisher:** Bethesda Softworks
* **Setting:** A fictional Caribbean-style island chain in the 1800s.

There's also a significant RPG element, with character development, dialogue choices, and quests.

75,"This page is a review of the Ultima Online expansion, ""Third Dawn,"" from PC Gamer magazine, dated July 2001.

**Review Summary:**

The review gives the expansion a 78% rating, categorized as ""Good.""  While praising the improvements, particularly the animations and new land, the reviewer criticizes the expansion for not being a significant leap forward from the original Ultima Online (U02).  The core gameplay mechanics remain largely the same, with the engine still exhibiting some stutters.  The reviewer suggests the expansion is more of a ""pretty wrapper"" than a revolutionary change.  The review also notes that Origin Systems had canceled plans for a sequel, Ultima Worlds Online, which would have been a more substantial update.

**Review Details:**

The review begins by acknowledging the expansion's positive aspects, highlighting the new land of Ilshenar, accessible only through magical portals.  It also praises the improved animations and character models, which are now polygonal instead of the previous 2D sprites.  The reviewer notes the increased detail in the landscapes and the greater variety of NPCs and wildlife.  The role-playing aspects are also mentioned as being improved.

**Criticisms:**

The review points out that the core engine remains similar to the original Ultima Online, with the same basic isometric perspective and some performance issues (stuttering).  The reviewer also notes that the expansion is essentially a new area to explore, rather than a complete overhaul of the game.  The review concludes by stating that while there are positive aspects, the expansion is not a replacement for the original game and is more of an incremental update.

**Additional Information:**

The page includes screenshots of the game, showcasing the new environments and characters.  The review also provides a ""Final Verdict"" section, summarizing the pros and cons of the expansion.

76,"This page is a review of the video game ""Robot Arena,"" published in PC Gamer, July 2001.

The review, written by Scott Humphries, gives the game a 32% rating, strongly recommending against purchasing it.

**Review Summary:**

The review criticizes the game's simplicity, poor AI, and buggy multiplayer mode.  While acknowledging decent graphics and sound effects, the reviewer finds the core gameplay repetitive and easy.  The AI is described as so rudimentary that players can easily corner and defeat opponents with minimal skill.  The reviewer also notes the lack of in-game commentary and post-game statistics, features common in similar televised competition-style games.  The multiplayer mode is also problematic, with frequent freezing and warping of robots.  The review concludes that the game is likely only enjoyable for a short time, and that the experience is not worth the purchase price.

**Game Overview (as presented in the review):**

The game is a budget title, part of a trend of ""extreme sport"" PC games.  It's a robot combat game, inspired by televised shows like BattleBots and Junkyard Wars.  Players create robots in a lab using various parts, including saw blades, air rams, hammers, and axes.  The battles take place in an arena.  The graphics are described as good, with impressive damage effects.  However, the music is repetitive rock/pop, and the sound effects, while impressive in some ways, are not realistic.  The game's core strategy is to corner and attack opponents, which the reviewer finds too simplistic.

**Technical Specifications (as presented in the review):**

The review mentions the minimum and recommended system requirements for the game, including processor speed (PII 266/PII 450), RAM (32MB/128MB), and hard drive space (100MB/16MB 3D card).

**Overall:**

The review is highly critical of ""Robot Arena,"" highlighting its simplicity, poor AI, and technical issues.  The reviewer concludes that the game is not worth the time or money, especially for players who are looking for a challenging or engaging experience.
"
77,"This is a PC Gamer review of the video game ""X-COM Enforcer,"" published in July 2001.

**Review Summary:**

The review gives the game a 57% rating, labeling it as ""Merely Okay.""  The reviewer, Rob Smolka, criticizes the game's repetitive nature, lack of in-level saving, and frustrating weapon-switching mechanic.  While acknowledging some positive aspects like cool weapon effects and decent graphics, the core gameplay loop is deemed monotonous.  The reviewer suggests the game is suitable for short bursts of play (20-minute sessions) rather than extended gaming marathons.

**Review Details:**

The review begins by stating that the game, despite its X-COM branding, is fundamentally different from the classic strategy series.  It's a run-and-gun arcade shooter, not a turn-based strategy game.  The game's premise involves an alien-killing machine controlled by a scientist, with 40 missions across various categories (finding transporters, rescuing humans, fighting boss creatures).

The review points out several key issues:

* **Repetitive Missions:**  The missions are described as largely similar, requiring players to keep firing and moving.  Time limits on some objectives add a minor twist, but the lack of in-level saving makes mistakes costly.
* **Weapon Switching:**  The game allows only one weapon at a time, and random weapons appear, making it frustrating to lose a powerful weapon and have to use a less effective one.
* **Limited Gameplay Depth:** The reviewer notes the lack of significant depth in the gameplay, with the core mechanics feeling simplistic.
* **Early Levels:** The early levels are criticized for being boring and focused on indoor locales, with more interesting alien environments and boss battles appearing only later in the game.
* **Online Play:** While the game supports online play through GameSpy, the review notes that the online experience isn't as polished as other games.

**Positive Aspects:**

* **Weapon Effects:** The review highlights the cool visual effects of the weapons as a positive aspect.
* **Graphics:** The game is described as decent-looking, with well-rendered aliens and varied weapon effects.
* **Bonus Levels:** The bonus levels, inspired by classic arcade games like Pac-Man and Frogger, are mentioned as a fun diversion.
* **Later Levels:** The later levels are praised for being more interesting in terms of design and content.

**Technical Specifications:**

The review includes the minimum and recommended PC specifications for running the game, including processor speed, RAM, hard drive space, and 3D card requirements.

**Overall:**

The review concludes that while the game might be enjoyable for short play sessions, its repetitive nature and lack of in-level saving make it less appealing for extended gaming.  The reviewer ultimately recommends the game only for players who can overlook these shortcomings.

The review also points out the pad's 35 programmable buttons (expandable to 70 with a shift button) and the ability to assign them to keyboard keystrokes or macros.  However, the reviewer criticizes the pad's large size, which is comparable to a standard keyboard, and the buttons' feel, which are not like standard gamepad buttons.

94,"This is an article from PC Gamer magazine, July 2001, titled ""Ever-Ball? Never Say Never.""  The article is an opinion piece by Rob Smoka, discussing the potential for massively multiplayer online (MMO) sports games.

The article opens with a brief introduction to the popularity of MMOs like EverQuest and Ultima Online, and then transitions to the core argument:  the possibility of applying the MMO model to sports games.

The author argues that existing MMOs have different types of players (casual, occasional, and devoted), and that a successful sports MMO would need to cater to all these types.  He proposes a ""pick-up game"" element for casual players, alongside more intensive, simulation-style career modes for hardcore players.

The author details a hypothetical structure for such a game, including:

* **Moderators/Commissioners:**  In-game moderators would act as commissioners, owners, and managers, with players potentially aspiring to these roles as the game grows.
* **Prizes and Competitions:**  Prizes and cross-server competitions would incentivize player engagement and dedication.
* **Invitational Tournaments:**  High-ranking players could be invited to monthly tournaments, benefiting league scouts.
* **Player Positions and ""Tryouts"":**  Certain positions (like pitcher and quarterback) would be highly sought after, with a system for players to ""try out"" for these positions.
* **Financial System:**  A points-based system could reward players and allow them to purchase in-game items or services.
* **Contracts and Teams:**  Players would need to commit to teams and show up for scheduled games.  Players who couldn't commit could still play pick-up games.
* **Spectator Mode:**  A spectator mode would allow players to watch their favorite teams or other players.

The author emphasizes the need for a ""totally new fan base"" – sports fans – to make such a game successful.  He also touches on the need for broadband internet access and a more mature online gaming community.

The article concludes with a call to action, encouraging readers to share their thoughts by emailing the author.  A small image of two hockey players in game-like uniforms is included.  The overall tone is enthusiastic and forward-thinking, exploring the potential of a new genre of online gaming.  The article is rated as an opinion piece, not a review of a specific game.
"
95,"This is a PC Gamer magazine article, specifically an opinion piece, from July 2001, titled ""Doom III Meets Flower Power.""  The author, Colin Williamson, is writing about the struggles and frustrations of Mac users in the FPS (First-Person Shooter) gaming community, particularly in the context of the release of Doom III.

The article begins with a humorous anecdote about the author's experience at Macworld, highlighting his cynical view of Apple's marketing and the perceived ""revolutionary"" nature of their products.  He describes his disdain for the new colored cases and the potential for his car to be vandalized if anyone saw his ""MACS ARE GOOD FOR KICKING"" bumper sticker.

The author then recounts a less humorous, but still relatable, experience of a technical issue with his internet connection, which prevented him from fully experiencing the event.

The core of the article is a critique of the Mac gaming community's perceived struggles with online FPS games, particularly in comparison to PC gamers.  He argues that Mac gamers are often frustrated by the lack of access to popular online games and the difficulty of competing with PC players.  He uses the example of a Mac gamer who won a tournament, but the author questions whether this success is truly representative of the broader Mac gaming experience.

The author also touches on the issue of Mac exclusivity for certain games, specifically mentioning Doom III's planned release on the Mac before the PC.  He expresses skepticism about this move, suggesting that it's a marketing ploy to garner attention and bragging rights for Apple users.

The article concludes with a call to developers to take Mac gamers more seriously and to provide better support for Mac platforms.  He suggests that Mac gamers are a valuable audience and that developers should consider their needs and preferences when creating and porting games.  The author also makes lighthearted comparisons between Mac gamers and other groups, such as professional wrestlers and giant rubbery monsters.

The overall tone of the article is critical, but also humorous and relatable.  The author's cynicism and sarcastic remarks are used to highlight the frustrations of Mac gamers, while also acknowledging the value of the Mac gaming community.  The article is clearly aimed at a gaming audience and is likely intended to spark discussion and debate about the issues raised.  There's no explicit review rating, but the article's tone and content suggest a critical, yet somewhat humorous, perspective on the topic.

99,"This page is from PC Gamer magazine, July 2001, and features an article titled ""In the Line of Fire"" by William R. Trotter.  The article delves into the details of a Swiss rifle, the ZUG-9, also known as the ""William Tell.""

The article begins with a brief introduction, followed by a detailed description of the ZUG-9's design and function.  A schematic diagram illustrates the rifle's complex mechanism, explaining how gas pressure from a fired round activates the cocking spring and piston, engaging the ""ejecting glove,"" and ultimately firing the round.  The article highlights the unusual design features, including the cantilevered spike that punctures a CO2 cartridge to create pressure, and the two-stage trigger mechanism requiring 8.6 lbs of squeeze for the second trigger pull.

The article also discusses the historical context of the ZUG-9, noting Switzerland's attempt to enter the international small arms market in 1938.  It emphasizes the rifle's unique design, calling it ""ingenious"" and ""over-engineered,"" but also noting the perhaps unfortunate design choice of a 13-round magazine capacity.

The article then touches on the Polish Army's interest in the ZUG-9, which ordered 400,000 rifles without testing them.  It also mentions the rarity of the firearm today and its high price on the collectors' market.  The article concludes by mentioning the ZUG-9's possible adaptation into a high-priced ski binding.

Below the main article, there's a section titled ""What's in a Name?""  This section features a reader's email complaint about the overuse of the word ""grognard"" in the magazine.  The author responds, suggesting alternative terms and even proposing a contest for better replacements.  The contest offers a slightly used copy of Hasbro's Squad Leader as a prize.

The page also includes a small image of the ZUG-9 rifle, along with a detailed diagram of its mechanism.  The page number and date are clearly visible at the bottom.

100,"This page is from PC Gamer magazine, July 2001, and features a review and overview of three different Air Traffic Control (ATC) simulation games for computers.  The article is titled ""Pushing Computer Tin"" and focuses on the growing market for these niche simulations.

The article begins with an introduction praising the growing popularity of ATC simulations, noting that there will be three new products released that year.  It highlights the unique appeal of these simulations, comparing them to the more common flight simulators.

The review then dives into three specific ATC simulators:

* **ATC Simulator (PC Aviator):**  This is described as the ""splashiest and most ambitious"" of the three.  It's rated 61% and is praised for its realistic representation of a TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control) radarscope, with 48 US airports and every knob, dial, and switch found on a real ARTS-IIIa radarscope.  The review notes the steep learning curve and the inclusion of a career mode and voice recognition software, though the latter is noted as not working reliably on many systems.  The price is $59.95.

* **Air Command 3.0 (Shrapnel Games):**  This is described as a more relaxed and game-like approach to ATC simulation.  It's designed to be more accessible to casual gamers, with a full-color map, digitized pilot voices, Doppler weather effects, and multiple difficulty levels.  The review highlights its user-friendly interface and the inclusion of 10 international airports.  The price is $34.95.

* **Air Traffic Control Center (Xavius Software):**  This is a freeware program, and the review notes its surprising depth and realistic radar sectors for major US cities.  It's described as a little rougher around the edges than the other two, but with a 59-page manual that emphasizes its complexity.  The review mentions that an updated version (2.0) is planned for later in the year with improved features.

The article also includes a brief section on the author's personal experience with ATC simulations and their appeal.  It also includes images of the different programs' interfaces, showing the radarscopes, control panels, and other key features.  The images highlight the differences in the visual design and complexity of each program.
