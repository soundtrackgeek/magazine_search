**Game Overview:**

The reviewer notes that ""Amazon Warrior"" shares numerous similarities with the popular game ""Forbidden Forest,"" including the scenario, opening sequence, music, and graphics.  The reviewer states that the programmer attempted to improve upon ""Forbidden Forest,"" but ultimately didn't succeed. The game takes place in the Amazon rainforest, where the player, a native, must overcome seven challenges using a blowpipe and poison darts to defeat various enemies.  The game progresses through stages, each with different types of enemies and obstacles.  The stages are described in detail, including the jungle, caverns, and temple environments, and the specific enemies encountered in each.

* **Graphics:**  The graphics receive a 78% rating, praised for excellent scrolling backgrounds and good character design.

* **Sound:**  The sound design is rated at 69%, with the reviewer noting that while not as good as ""Forbidden Forest,"" there are one or two good sound effects.

* **Originality:**  The reviewer gives the game an abysmal 8% for originality, stating it's a blatant rip-off of ""Forbidden Forest.""

* **Hookability:**  The hookability is rated at 54%, with the reviewer noting that the difficult blowpipe control makes progressing through the game challenging.

* **Lastability:**  The game's lasting appeal is rated at 60%, described as ""very tough but unaddictive.""

* **Value for Money:**  The reviewer gives the game a 51% rating for value, suggesting that if you already own ""Forbidden Forest,"" you'll likely find this game a waste of money.

**Overall Impression:**

The review is largely negative, highlighting the game's similarities to ""Forbidden Forest"" and criticizing the lack of originality and improved gameplay.  The reviewer feels the game is a poor attempt to capitalize on the success of a previous title.  The review also notes that while the graphics and presentation are decent, the sound and gameplay are not up to the standard of the game it's trying to emulate.

58,"The image appears to be a promotional or game guide page for a video game, likely for a 1980s or early 1990s arcade or home computer game called ""Warrior.""

The page is dominated by a visual representation of a game's map or level design.  It shows a grid-like structure, with various colored blocks and symbols.  These likely represent different sections of the level, obstacles, or perhaps even resources.  The symbols and colors are not easily decipherable without knowing the game's rules.  The text ""OVERLAP"" at the top left suggests a technical aspect of the game's design or level layout.

Below the grid, there's a stylized graphic of the game's title, ""WARRIOR,"" presented in a bold, blocky font.  The graphic itself resembles a complex, 3D-like representation of a maze or a section of a level.  The colors used are muted, with shades of gray, light blue, and red.

The style and design elements suggest a game from the 1980s or early 1990s.  There is no review rating visible on the page.
"
59,"The image is a page from a game manual or instruction booklet, likely for a video game.  It's dense with information, and appears to be a combination of diagrams, charts, and text.

The majority of the page is a complex grid or matrix, filled with various symbols, letters, and numbers.  These appear to be codes, identifiers, or instructions related to game mechanics, levels, or specific actions within the game.  The grid is organized into rows and columns, with different colored sections and symbols within each cell.  The letters and numbers are likely used to identify specific locations, objects, or actions within the game world.

Below and to the right of the main grid, there are smaller diagrams and icons. These appear to be visual representations of different game elements, such as ""Dead Zone Lines,"" ""Speed Mats,"" ""Anti Bounce Damage Mats,"" and ""Teleport Room.""  These are likely explanations of different game features and how they function.

There's also a section with text, including copyright information, the year (1984), and the names of individuals involved in the game's creation (Gary Penn, Gordon Druce, and Oliver Frey).  The text also mentions ""Newsfield Ltd"" and the year 1985, suggesting a publishing or development company.

The section is titled ""How to be a great Psi Warrior.""  The introductory paragraph highlights the complexity of the game, but then assures the reader that it's not as difficult as it initially seems.  A graphic of a Psi Warrior character is prominently displayed.

The article then breaks down various game mechanics and strategies into distinct sections:

* **SPEED MATS, ANTI DAMAGE MATS, and BOUNCE MATS:** These are special surfaces within the game's environment.  Speed Mats allow for quick movement and jumps, Anti Damage Mats allow the player's vehicle to land on them without damage, and Bounce Mats cause the player to bounce off them at the same speed and angle they hit them.  The article describes how these surfaces appear visually in the game (striped blue for Speed, striped green for Anti Damage, and solid blue for Bounce).

* **DEAD ZONE LINES:** These are obstacles that can only be crossed in one direction.  The article warns players to be careful of these lines, as getting caught in a loop can be problematic.

* **LIFTS:**  The article explains how to use lifts safely, emphasizing the importance of stopping and pushing in the correct direction.  It also notes that players can hover above lifts.

* **LEVEL MARKERS:** These markers indicate the player's position on each level of the game's environment.  The article points out that these markers are initially difficult to decipher, but the player can figure them out using a reference chart.

* **THE SOURCE:** This is a recurring element in the game that appears on the left side of the screen.  The article explains that the player must hit it three times quickly to avoid disorientation.  The player's Psi and Id values affect the duration of this disorientation.

* **PUPAE:** These are semi-human energy forms that wander the environment.  The article advises players not to shoot them, as doing so will trigger a difficult battle.  Instead, players should coax them into a transportation chamber.

The article then moves into a section on the game's core mechanics, focusing on Psi and Id energy:

* **PSI and ID ENERGY:**  This section explains the importance of Psi and Id energy in the game.  It describes how Id energy is used for various actions, and how Psi energy is needed to control Id energy.  The article also introduces the concept of ""Stability Coefficient"" (SC), which is a measure of the balance between Psi and Id energy.  If the SC reaches zero, the player loses.

* **ENERGY COLLECTION:** The article provides tips on collecting large amounts of Psi and Id energy, including hanging around areas with high concentrations of these energies.

* **FOUR SKILLS:** The article details four skills that can be unlocked using Id energy:
    * **TELEPORTATION:**  Players can teleport between designated chambers by logging their coordinates.  This action depletes Id energy.
    * **REMOTE VIEWING:**  Players can leave their vehicle and look around the environment using the joystick.
    * **LEVITATION:**  Players can levitate over obstacles using a significant amount of Psi and Id energy.
    * **INVISIBILITY:**  Players can become invisible, but this also depletes Id energy.

The article concludes with a summary of the tips and strategies for effectively playing the game.  The overall review rating is not explicitly stated, but the tone suggests a positive assessment of the game's mechanics and strategies.
