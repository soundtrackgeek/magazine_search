**Review Summary:** The review gives a rating of 84% overall.  The individual categories are: Sound 80%, Graphics 82%, Playability 86%, and Stability 86%.  The reviewer notes that while the game has a lot of detail, it might give away some of the surprises.  However, the reviewer also points out that the game is a little unrealistic in assuming that the player will have no idea how the game functions after researching a project.

The reviewer highlights the research and production aspects, noting that only one project can be researched and one item can be in production at any given time.  The game uses a real-time clock, allowing the player to advance time by hours or days.

There's also a section with the title ""Vacancies on the moon,"" which is likely a reference to the game's gameplay.  The page number ""35"" is visible at the bottom right corner.

**Review Details:**

* **Game Title:** Ringside
* **Publisher:** E.A.S.
* **Price:** £24.95
* **Rating:** 70% (Overall)

The review is written by Mark Heley and is broken down into several sections.

**Gameplay and Features:**

The reviewer praises the game's graphics and well-defined sprites, but notes that the boxing simulation's success hinges on its flexibility.  The reviewer finds the repetitive nature of punching opponents, especially PR people, a bit tedious.  However, the game allows players to adjust the strength of punches and gain points to enhance abilities, making the game more engaging.  The reviewer highlights the presence of various punches and tactics, though they aren't always textbook-perfect.  The game's ability to hold player attention for a longer period than average is also noted as a positive.

**Simulation Accuracy:**

The reviewer acknowledges that the game isn't a perfect simulation of boxing, but it does offer a good compromise.  It doesn't perfectly capture the nuances of the sport, but it does provide a fun and engaging experience.  The reviewer also points out that the game doesn't realistically simulate getting your nose broken, which is a humorous observation.

**Multiplayer Mode:**

The review mentions that the game has a one-player and two-player mode.  The reviewer finds the two-player mode entertaining, but also notes that the game's ""absurd sequence"" between rounds (where players have to wave a towel) doesn't significantly enhance the gameplay.

**Graphics, Sound, and Playability:**

The review provides specific ratings for different aspects of the game:

* **Graphics:** 71%
* **Sound:** 55%
* **Playability:** 68%
* **Lastability:** 66%

**Overall Impression:**

The reviewer concludes that Ringside is a decent boxing simulator, offering a good amount of entertainment, especially in the two-player mode.  However, it falls short of being a perfect simulation of the sport.

**Additional Notes:**

* **""Boxing's view of girlies"":**  A small image of a woman in a stereotypical boxing-related outfit is present, likely a humorous aside.
* **Screen Shots:**  The page includes several screen captures of the game in action, showcasing the boxing ring and characters.
* **Reviewer's Opinion:** The reviewer's personal opinion and observations are woven throughout the review.
