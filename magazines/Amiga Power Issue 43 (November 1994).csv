However, this is presented as a minor positive in a game that is otherwise uninspired.

64,"This page is a game review for ""On the Ball League Edition,"" a football management game for the Amiga.  The review, written by Brian, gives the game a mixed rating.

**Review Summary:**

The review begins by stating that the game, despite the reviewer's initial high expectations (based on a previous 85% review of the World Cup Edition), falls short of expectations.  The reviewer criticizes several aspects of the game, including the transfer market, the random events, and the overall realism.

67,"The image is an advertisement for a video game called ""DreamWeb,"" likely from the 1990s, judging by the graphics and the mention of Commodore Amiga and IBM PC compatibility.

The advertisement features a stylized image of a man with sunglasses, set against a backdrop of vibrant, somewhat chaotic colors.  The image is a significant part of the advertisement's visual appeal.

The text is presented in a combination of handwritten-style text and more formal, printed text.  The handwritten text, which appears to be a narrative or a log of events, creates a sense of urgency and drama.  Phrases like ""The clock keeps going round,"" ""Santa Claus gave a gun to me,"" and ""Let loose the puppies of War"" are examples of this.  The handwritten style is contrasted with the more formal, printed text that describes the game's features, platform compatibility (IBM PC and compatibles, IBM PC CD-ROM, Commodore Amiga - all models, Commodore Amiga A1200 Enhanced), and the publisher (Empire Interactive).

The advertisement also includes several small, pixelated images, likely screenshots or concept art from the game, which provide a glimpse into the game's visual style.  These images are interspersed with the text and contribute to the overall impression of the game's atmosphere.

The advertisement includes a prominent rating symbol (R) and a 18 rating, indicating that the game contains content that may not be suitable for younger audiences.  The accompanying text further clarifies this with a warning about graphic violence and scenes of sex.

"
68,"This page is an article from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, focused on the topic of in-game music in video games.  The article is a review or critique, not a traditional product review, but rather an analysis of a common issue in game design.

The article is titled ""TOOL OF THE DEVIL"" and features a bold statement by Jonathan Nash: ""In-game music is a tool of the devil.""  The article then proceeds to elaborate on this point, arguing that in-game music is often poorly designed and repetitive, failing to enhance the gameplay experience.

The article is structured as a feature, with a slightly informal tone.  It's broken down into sections, each addressing a different type of game and how in-game music is often handled in those genres.  The sections are numbered and clearly labeled:

* **1. IF THE GAME IS A SHOOT-EM-UP:**  The article argues that in shoot-em-up games, the music often relies on repetitive, thunderous drum tracks with militaristic samples and echo effects.  This is presented as a common, and often unsuccessful, approach.

* **2. IF THE GAME IS A CUTE PLATFORMER:**  The article contrasts this with platformers, where the music is described as ""rinky-tink"" with ""round, cheery samples.""  The tone suggests this style is more acceptable, but still not necessarily effective.

* **3. IF THE GAME IS A BEAT-'EM-UP:**  The music in beat-'em-ups is described as having thunderous drum tracks that increase in speed to match the game's action.  Again, the article implies this approach is common but not necessarily well-executed.

* **4. IF THE GAME IS AN ADVENTURE OR RPG:**  The music in adventure and RPG games is described as using lute-like or ambient pieces, or, in the case of *Monkey Island*, repetitive bars.  The article suggests that this approach is sometimes used, but doesn't necessarily address the quality of the music.

* **5. IF THE GAME IS ANYTHING ELSE:**  This section covers games that don't fit into the previous categories.  The article notes that the music in these games often runs around for a while, then pretends to be a different genre (shoot-'em-up, platformer, etc.)  The tone is critical, suggesting that the music is often poorly integrated and repetitive.

The article also includes screenshots of game menus and gameplay, showing the game's score and other relevant information.  There are also humorous observations, such as a picture intended as a joke about percussion.

The overall tone of the article is critical of the common practice of in-game music, arguing that it often fails to enhance the gameplay experience and is frequently repetitive.  The article doesn't offer specific solutions, but rather highlights the problem and the common approaches to solving it.  The review rating is not explicitly stated, but the overall tone suggests a negative or critical assessment of in-game music in general.
"
69,"This page is a feature article from a magazine, likely *AMIGA Power*, from November 1994.  The feature focuses on the use of music in Amiga games, highlighting how the music can enhance the gameplay experience.  The article is titled ""Tool of the Devil,"" and the page number is 69.

The article is structured around several sections, each showcasing a different aspect of how music is used in games.

**OBEY US:** This section discusses how the magazine believes using genuine music in games, rather than generic sound effects, can enhance the gaming experience.  It argues that a context-sensitive approach, where the music changes with the action on the screen, is a more effective way to immerse the player.  The section also mentions the use of stereo headphones, a jukebox, and other equipment to create a more immersive experience.

**DOGFIGHT OF DOOM:** This section describes a specific game scenario, likely a game featured in the magazine, where the music changes dramatically to reflect the changing action and tension of the game.  It highlights the use of Mozart's *Marriage of Figaro* overture and Wagner's *Ride of the Valkyries* to create different moods and emphasize the dramatic moments in the game.

**INCREASING DRAMATIC TENSION WITH MUSIC OF AN INAPPROPRIATE FLAVOUR:** This section describes how music can be used to create tension and drama in games, even if the music is not directly related to the game's theme.  It gives examples of games using music from different genres, like disco or classical music, to create a specific atmosphere.

**COUNTER-POINTING SCENES OF EXPLOSIVE VIOLENCE WITH CLASSICAL MUSIC:** This section describes how music can be used to contrast different elements of a game.  It gives an example of a game where classical music is used to accompany scenes of violence, creating a unique and unexpected effect.

**CAPTURING THE RHYTHM OF THE GAME WITH MUSIC OF A SIMILAR TEMPO:** This section describes how music can be used to create a sense of rhythm and tempo in games.  It gives an example of a racing game where the music is synchronized with the car's speed and actions.

**USING SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN METHODS OF SUBLIMINAL MUSICAL HYPNOTISM:** This section is the most intriguing, discussing the use of subliminal musical cues to affect the player's experience.  It describes a game where sub-sonic frequencies are used to create a sense of relaxation or tension.

**SAMPLE GAMES:** Throughout the article, there are several sample games mentioned, each demonstrating a different approach to using music in gaming.  The descriptions of these games provide specific details about how the music is used to enhance the gameplay experience.

**REVIEW RATING:**  There is no explicit review rating.  The article is more of a feature article discussing the use of music in games, rather than a traditional review of a specific game.

**OTHER DETAILS:** The article includes images of people playing games and illustrations of game scenarios, which help to visualize the concepts being discussed.  The article also includes quotes from the developers or designers of the games, which provide insight into their creative process.  The overall tone of the article is enthusiastic and informative, highlighting the potential of music to enhance the gaming experience.
