24,"This page contains an article titled ""Programming for the Beginner: A Structured Start.""  It's a tutorial or introductory guide to structured programming.

The article begins with an introduction that explains how computer programming has evolved from a more artistic, less structured process to a more organized and systematic one.  The author, Ronald T. Herman, emphasizes the benefits of structured programming techniques for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

The text then outlines the advantages of a structured approach to programming development:

* **Ease of Learning:**  It allows novice programmers to grasp programming logic without needing to be concerned with specific machine languages or low-level details like bytes.  This makes it easier to understand the flow of a program.
* **Error Reduction:**  Following structured techniques correctly leads to programs with fewer logical errors, making debugging easier.  The programs are more readily debugged and understood.
* **Communication:** Pseudocode, a structured programming tool, allows programmers to exchange ideas and share program designs regardless of the specific programming language or machine.

The article also discusses the drawbacks of structured programming, primarily the psychological challenge of writing straightforward code that adheres to simple rules.

The article then moves to the core of the tutorial: the ""Building Blocks of Structure.""  It explains that structured programs can be built from simple components that each have a single input and a single output.  The article promises to present some of these fundamental building blocks and illustrate their use with an example program.

The page concludes with a section titled ""The Building Blocks of Structure,"" which likely details the specific building blocks of structured programming, such as sequence, selection (if-then-else), and iteration (loops).  The article also promises to provide an example of a simple program using these blocks.

The page number ""22"" is present at the bottom, indicating it's likely part of a larger document.  There are no review ratings or reviews present on the page.
"
25,"This page contains a technical document, likely from a textbook or similar educational resource, explaining different programming structures.  It describes the SEQUENCE, IFTHENELSE, DOWHILE, and DOUNTIL programming blocks.  Each section provides a detailed explanation of the structure, its purpose, and how it's used in programming.

**SEQUENCE Block:**  This is described as the simplest structure, consisting of a series of steps executed one after another.  A diagram (Figure 1) illustrates this with two processes (A and B) sequentially executed.

**IFTHENELSE Block:** This structure allows for decision-making based on a condition (""p"").  If the condition is true, one set of instructions (the ""THEN"" block) is executed; otherwise, another set (the ""ELSE"" block) is executed.  Figure 2 shows a diagram of this structure, with a condition ""P"" leading to either process A or process B.  The example given involves checking transactions (deposits or withdrawals) in a checking account.

**DOWHILE Block:** This structure repeats a block of instructions as long as a condition (""p"") is true.  The condition is tested *before* each iteration.  Figure 3 shows a diagram of this structure.  The example given involves processing transactions until there are no more transactions to process.

**DOUNTIL Block:** This structure is similar to DOWHILE, but the condition is tested *after* each iteration.  The block of instructions is repeated until the condition becomes true.  The example given involves reading characters from a keyboard until a carriage return is encountered.

**General Information:** The document emphasizes the importance of structured programming in reducing errors and improving code readability.  It uses pseudocode examples to illustrate the concepts, and the pseudocode format is explained.  The use of indentation and punctuation (though optional in some cases) is highlighted as crucial for readability.

**Overall:** The page is well-organized, with clear explanations and diagrams to illustrate the different programming structures.  The examples provided are practical and help the reader understand how these structures can be applied in real-world programming scenarios.  The document is likely part of a larger work on programming fundamentals.
"
26,"This page contains several diagrams and explanations related to programming structures, specifically focusing on looping and selection structures.  It's likely a section from a programming textbook or tutorial.

The page describes three fundamental programming structures:

* **DOWHILE Structure:**  This is a looping structure that repeats a sequence of instructions (labeled ""PROCESS A"") as long as a condition (labeled ""P"") is true.  The condition is checked *before* the sequence is executed.  The diagram illustrates the flow of control with arrows and decision points (diamonds).  The text explains that the sequence might be executed zero or more times, depending on how quickly the condition becomes false.

* **DOUNTIL Structure:**  Similar to DOWHILE, but the condition (""P"") is checked *after* the sequence is executed.  The sequence will repeat until the condition becomes true.  The text emphasizes the difference in when the condition is evaluated.

* **SELECT Structure:** This is a more comprehensive selection structure, allowing for multiple possible paths based on different conditions.  The diagram shows a ""CASE"" structure where different sequences of instructions (labeled ""PROCESS A,"" ""PROCESS B,"" and ""PROCESS C"") are executed depending on the result of a determination.  The text highlights that this structure is a more concise way to handle multiple choices compared to a series of nested IF-THEN-ELSE statements.

The page also includes a practical example of using the SELECT structure in a bookkeeping scenario.  It demonstrates how to update different accounts (food, medical, car, electric) based on the type of transaction.  Two different implementations of the SELECT structure are shown, one using nested IF-THEN-ELSE statements and the other using the more structured SELECT block.

The page is well-organized with clear diagrams and accompanying text explanations.  The diagrams use standard flowcharting symbols to represent the flow of control in each structure.  The example demonstrates how these structures can be used in a real-world application.  The overall impression is that the page is intended to teach programming concepts.

**Title:** Strike a MATCH

**Author:** Phillip L. Hansford, 6841 Haywood St, Tujunga CA 91042

**Content Overview:**

The article details a program designed to match penpals based on criteria like age, vocation, and interests.  It explains the underlying logic and implementation specifics, focusing on how the program works within the limitations of the Altair 8800's architecture.

**Sections:**

* **Introduction:**  The author explains the program's purpose and its applicability to other similar systems.  It highlights the program's evolution from a simple experimental project to a practical tool for a penpal club.  The article emphasizes the program's ability to select compatible penpals from a large pool of choices.

* **Penpals:** This section describes how penpal data is structured.  Each penpal has an octal file number and an octal code number that specifies characteristics like age, vocation, and interests.  The program requires two words of memory for each penpal.  The article notes the program's capacity for 80 people, expandable to 208 with additional memory.  Crucially, it explains the limitations of the file numbers (255 non-zero names) and the importance of avoiding zero and 377 as file numbers.

* **Table 1:** This table is a key component for understanding how the program determines penpal matches.  It shows how four-bit patterns (represented as numbers 0-3) correspond to different age ranges, languages, interests, and vocations.  The table provides an example of how these factors are combined to create a unique code number for each penpal.

* **Program Operation:** The article details how the program works to find matches.  It explains that the program reads input from sense switches, searches a memory table for matching penpal profiles, and skips even addresses in the memory table.  The program uses the file number (at an even address) and the code number (at an odd address) to locate the penpal data.  If a match is found, the program adjusts its pointer to the next penpal.

* **Hardware Considerations:** The article notes that the program's input and output are currently handled through sense switches and LEDs, highlighting the lack of peripherals.  It suggests that the addition of input/output devices would improve the program's usability.

**Overall Impression:**

"
52,"This page contains technical documentation, likely from a vintage computer manual or similar publication, describing a program for an Altair 8800-type computer.  It's a detailed explanation of a program called ""MATCH"" and a supporting program called ""EXECUTIV.""

**Listing 1 (MATCH):**

The first section describes the MATCH program, highlighting its expansion to utilize more programmable RAM.  It explains how the program initializes, handles input from sense switches, and performs a search and match operation within a subroutine.  Crucially, it details a bug fix related to stack overflow issues when the program wasn't properly reset before running.  The revised program now moves the match program's location in memory to accommodate the increased RAM.  The documentation also explains how the program coordinates with the operating system and handles various conditions, including the use of interrupts.

**Listing 2 (EXECUTIV):**

This section describes a smaller program, ""EXECUTIV,"" designed to be accessed via an auxiliary switch interrupt.  This program reads sense switches to determine which program to run.  It uses a flag called ""CALLBUFF"" to decide whether to process data input or select a program.  The listing provides a table of the program's instructions, including the opcodes, operands, and labels.  The table shows the memory addresses, the corresponding octal codes, and the instructions' purpose.

53,"This page contains technical documentation, likely from a vintage computer magazine or manual, describing a hardware modification to the Altair 8800 computer.  The modification allows the Aux 2 switch to generate an interrupt, enabling the coordination of simple executive programs and input to the MATCH program.

**Figure 1:**  Illustrates the hardware modification.  A diagram shows the Aux 2 switch, its center point, the reset switch, and the upper contact for the down position.  A wire connection to pin #73 (PINT) on the mother board is also depicted.  The diagram clearly explains how to connect the Aux 2 switch to generate an interrupt signal.

**Detailed Description of the Modification:**

The text explains how the processing was changed to use an RST 0 instruction, allowing the program to run from a different output location.  The configuration, as shown in listing 1, uses the same high address for the output list throughout.  The modification includes no-ops to preserve performance when inserting instructions at specific memory locations (002/017 and 002/020).  These instructions load a 307 (RST 0) at the end of program execution.  The initialization part of the program automatically clears a no-op before it (at 003/376).  This allows for up to 12 answers to be handled, and the program to restart correctly if interrupted.  The text also notes that if more than 10 answers occur, careful tracking is needed to avoid errors.  Overflow issues are addressed for memory beyond 003/377.

The modification also includes a provision to limit the number of answers, easily accomplished using four bytes.  A flag called CALLBUFF (002/054) is initialized to all ones, and the executive program checks this flag before selecting a new program.  If the flag is zero, the executive returns to the previous (interrupted) program.  This allows for data input into a program through the A register, with the sense switches and interrupt.  The CALLBUFF (002/054) needs to be cleared in the program.

**Executive Program Description:**

The text describes the executive program, which is small and straightforward.  It can direct the computer to five distinct locations, including the matching program.  The executive program runs from address 000/000 and automatically jumps to the matching program, remaining in the output loop until stopped or interrupted.  To run a different program, the appropriate code is placed on the sense switches, and the interrupt (Aux 2) is pressed.  A delay of 0.75 seconds is included to allow the user time to release the switch.  The executive initializes CALLBUFF to all ones when the system is first run through the matching program.  The executive tests this location to ensure the condition before selecting a new program.  If all zeros are present at the call buffer, the executive returns to the previous (interrupted) program.

**Interrupt Switch:**

The text explains the addition of an interrupt switch to the Altair 8800, which is connected to the Aux 2 switch.  This interrupt function is easily accomplished by running a jumper from the center terminal on the Aux 2 switch to ground.

**Overall:**

The page provides a detailed technical description of a hardware modification and the associated software changes for the Altair 8800 computer.  It emphasizes the use of interrupts and the executive program to manage program execution and input.  The text is clear and well-organized, providing a good understanding of the system's functionality.

The program appears to be an input-driven system, handling user commands and requests.  The flowchart shows a loop, indicating that the program continuously waits for input, processes it, and then returns to the input stage.  A ""GO"" command is highlighted as a way to exit the main loop and execute a different program or function.

**Figure 4: The Input Subroutine**

This flowchart details a subroutine within the larger ELM program, specifically focused on handling input.  The subroutine, named ""INPUT,"" reads lines of text from the input device.  Crucially, it handles line editing functions, including deleting characters and entire lines.  The flowchart shows how the input is stored in a buffer (LB) and how the program processes the carriage return character to mark the end of a line.

**Figure 7 (implied): The LIST Routine**

While not explicitly shown as a flowchart, the text describes a routine called ""LIST.""  This routine takes input parameters to specify memory locations and prints out the hexadecimal values stored at those locations.  The output is formatted 20 bytes per line.  The text also mentions that the routine uses an ""end of program mark"" at address zero, which is a common convention for terminating programs.

**Overall:**

The flow chart is presented as a series of boxes and arrows, representing different steps and decision points in the subroutine.  The boxes contain instructions or actions, such as ""LOAD MESSAGE,"" ""CALL INPUT,"" ""CONVERT LB(P) TO BINARY,"" ""ERROR MESSAGE AND RESTART,"" and ""LAST ADDRESS MESSAGE.""  The arrows indicate the flow of execution, showing which step follows another.

The text accompanying the diagram explains the purpose of the LOAD subroutine.  It's designed to load the contents of user-programmable memory, starting at a location specified by the user.  The routine continues until it encounters the characters ""END"" at the beginning of a line of input.

The text also describes how the LOAD subroutine works in relation to the input format.  It expects lines of hexadecimal codes, with carriage returns and multiple delete characters at the end of each line.  The subroutine skips over blank spaces between bytes to save tape space.  When the processor encounters a carriage return, it begins loading the memory from the line buffer.  The delete characters provide time for the computer to load the line before the next character arrives.  The subroutine uses the word ""END"" as a signal to stop loading.  However, the subroutine can be modified to use a different signal, such as a different hexadecimal code.

The page also mentions ""expansions"" to the LOAD subroutine, suggesting that the basic function can be extended to handle additional commands or data formats.  Specifically, it mentions the possibility of adding commands like ""LOADPT"" and ""PUNCH"" for use with teletype machines.  These commands would likely handle the specific requirements of a teletype, such as printing and punching data onto paper tape.

The page also notes that the input parameter decoding routine can be simplified by using hexadecimal parameters.  This suggests that the input data is in a hexadecimal format, and the subroutine is designed to handle that format efficiently.

Overall, the page provides a detailed technical description of a computer subroutine, including its purpose, operation, and potential expansions.  The flow chart visually represents the steps involved in the subroutine, making it easier to understand the logic and sequence of operations.

"
79,"This page contains a technical discussion of computer memory addressing.  It's likely an excerpt from a larger document, possibly a textbook or technical manual, judging by the presence of diagrams and figures.

The text describes different methods of addressing memory in a computer system.  It uses an analogy to the postal system to explain the concepts.  The author likens a memory address to a street address, and the data to be retrieved to a letter.

**Key Concepts and Sections:**

* **Immediate Addressing:**  This section explains how a constant value can be directly included in an instruction.  The example uses the number 18, which is treated as a constant in calculations, but could also be used as an address in a different context.  The analogy used is that of a fixed number in a calculation, like a street number.

* **Direct Addressing:** This section explains how a specific memory location is directly referenced by a number in the instruction.  The example uses the address 18 Grove St. to locate Dr. Smith.  The analogy is that of a specific address used to deliver a letter.

* **Address Formation/Computation:** The text discusses the process of calculating the actual memory address to be used.  This involves combining information from the instruction and other registers within the computer.

* **Effective Address:** The text defines the effective address as the final address used to access the data.

* **Addressing Modes:** The text highlights the importance of understanding different addressing modes (immediate and direct, in this case) for programmers to effectively use the computer's instruction set.

* **Figure 3:** This figure is a diagram illustrating the concept of a memory address being analogous to a postal address.  It shows a simplified representation of mailboxes (memory locations) with corresponding addresses (memory addresses).

**Overall:**

The page provides a clear explanation of fundamental computer memory addressing concepts, using relatable analogies to make the technical information more accessible.  The use of the postal system analogy is particularly effective in illustrating the core ideas.  The text also touches on the practical implications of different addressing modes and the importance of understanding them for programming.
"
80,"This page describes different addressing modes in computer architecture, specifically focusing on how instructions access data in memory.  It's a technical document, likely from a textbook or similar educational resource.

The text discusses several methods for specifying memory locations, categorized under ""Addressing With Registers.""

**Addressing With Registers:**

The text begins with an analogy to illustrate the concept of relative addressing.  It uses the example of sending a letter to Dr. Smith, where the post office (computer) needs a relative address (15 Grove St, fourth mailbox) rather than an absolute address.

The document then explains different types of addressing using registers:

* **Absolute/Direct Addressing:**  A fixed memory address is directly embedded in the instruction.

* **Indexed Addressing (Figure 4):**  An index register's value is added to a base address (or offset) to determine the effective address.  The index register can hold either a base address or an offset, and the modifier field is interpreted accordingly.  This method is common and allows for flexibility in accessing data.

* **Double Register Addressing (Figure 5):**  Instructions use two registers, one as a base and the other as an index, to calculate the effective address.  This provides more complex addressing capabilities.

* **Program Counter Relative Addressing (Figure 7):**  Similar to indexed addressing, but the base address is implicitly the current instruction's address (program counter).  This is useful for branching and looping.

The text also discusses the practical implications of these addressing modes, including:

* **Size limitations of index registers:**  Some processors have smaller index registers than the full address space, requiring the use of displacements.

* **Relocation:**  How programs can be moved in memory without changing the instructions that reference them.  Base registers are crucial for this.

* **Jump instructions:**  How instructions can jump to different parts of the program using base and displacement values.

* **Branch instructions:**  How program flow is controlled using program counter relative addressing.

The page includes diagrams (Figures 4, 5, and 7) that visually illustrate the different addressing modes and how the components interact.  These diagrams show the flow of data between registers and the calculation of effective addresses.

Overall, the page provides a detailed explanation of various addressing techniques in computer architecture, using clear examples and diagrams to illustrate the concepts.  The text is technical but well-explained, suitable for someone learning about computer systems.
"
81,"This page contains technical information about computer architecture, specifically addressing modes.  It's likely an excerpt from a textbook or technical manual.

The page is divided into several sections, each explaining a different addressing method.

**Figure 5: Combining Two Index Registers:** This section describes a method of calculating an address using a base register, an index register, and a modifier.  It explains that the effective address is the sum of these values, and the order of calculation depends on the processor design.

**Figure 6: A base register scheme:** This section details how a base register can be used to make code relocation easier.  It explains how the target address of an instruction (like a jump) can be specified using a base address register and a displacement.  The example shows how the same program can be loaded at different memory locations by changing the base register value.  The text uses a postal analogy to illustrate the concept.

**Figure 7: Program Counter Relative Addressing:** This section describes a method where the address is calculated relative to the current value of the program counter.  The instruction contains a displacement value, which the processor adds to the program counter to get the effective address.  The analogy used is that the displacement is like a relative address in a postal system.

**Figure 8: Indirect Addressing:** This section explains indirect addressing, where the effective address is used to retrieve a second effective address.  It describes how this works in a computer, using a postal analogy to illustrate the concept.  The example shows how a mail forwarding address can be used to find the final destination.  The text also mentions that this method can be extended to multiple levels of indirection.

**Overall:** The page provides a detailed explanation of different ways to calculate memory addresses in a computer system.  The use of analogies (like the postal service) helps to make the complex concepts more understandable.  The figures and diagrams clearly illustrate the different addressing modes.  The page is likely part of a larger document on computer architecture."
82,"This page contains technical information about addressing modes in computer architecture.  It's a section of a larger document, likely a textbook or technical manual, judging by the numbered figures and the ""Summary"" section.

The page focuses on **indirect addressing**, a method where an address in memory holds the address of the actual data.  The text explains how this works, using an analogy of a postal system to illustrate the concept.  It describes how a letter might be routed through multiple intermediate addresses before reaching its final destination.

**Figure 8** visually depicts the process of indirect addressing, showing how a decoded instruction leads to a first effective address, which then leads to a second (indirect) effective address, ultimately locating the desired data.

**Figure 9** presents a flowchart (algorithm) for a general address evaluation process. This algorithm combines various addressing modes (like base register, index register, and indirection) to calculate the final memory address.  The flowchart details the steps involved in determining the effective address.

The text accompanying the figures explains the different addressing modes, including:

* **Immediate Addressing:** The data is part of the instruction itself.
* **Direct/Absolute Addressing:** The address of the data is explicitly given in the instruction.
* **Indexed Addressing:** The effective address is calculated by adding a value from a register (or registers) to a base address.
* **PC Relative Addressing:** The program counter (PC) is used as a base address, with an offset specified in the instruction.
* **Indirect Addressing:** The effective address is found by following a pointer stored in memory.

The text also discusses the **General Address Evaluation Algorithm**, highlighting how indirect addressing can be combined with other modes to create complex address calculations.  It notes that this algorithm is common in minicomputers but less frequently implemented in microcomputers of the time.

A **Summary** section briefly reviews the different addressing modes.
