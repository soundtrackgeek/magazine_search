The reviewer, G.H., initially anticipates a game similar to ""Mercenary,"" but finds ""Echelon"" significantly slower and less engaging than expected.

The reviewer concludes that while the effort is commendable, the game's slowness and unrealistic aspects detract from the experience.  The reviewer gives the game a negative overall assessment.

**Game Description (from the review):**

The game ""Echelon"" is set in the 21st century on the planet Isis.  Players take on missions in three modes: Scientific (exploration), Patrol (mild resistance), and Military (non-stop enemy attacks).
