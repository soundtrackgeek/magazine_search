**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing the game's premise: a spaceship navigating through a vast number of ""eigenspaces"" accessed via ""stargates.""  The player must collect resources (fuel, weapons) from various locations within these spaces.  The game features five key locations containing specific geometric shapes (cube, tetrahedron, dodecahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron).  The game map displays stargates, routes, and other satellites within the eigenspace.  The game starts with a two-minute loading period, followed by the universe appearing on the screen.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

The reviewer highlights the game's control method as a significant aspect.  The game uses a continuous spin induced by moving the mouse left or right, with thrust gained by moving the mouse forward and missiles launched with a mouse button click.  The reviewer notes that while this method is ""well suited"" to the game, it can be ""fiddly.""  The reviewer also mentions the presence of enemy ships, chaff pods, and heat-seeking missiles.  The enemy ships are described as becoming more devious and appearing from the bottom of the screen, which means they spend half their time hidden by the ship's control panel.

**Criticisms:**

The reviewer criticizes the game's lack of engaging objectives, stating that it feels like a ""total lack of real fun objectives.""  The reviewer also notes that the game's difficulty and repetitive nature make it feel like a ""waste of time.""

The reviewer finds the game's control method to be fiddly and the lack of engaging objectives to be a significant drawback.  The reviewer ultimately concludes that the game ""stumbles, falls and lands smack on its nose.""

The game also features special items like mega-whips and foxheads.

The review begins by noting the reviewer's initial disappointment with the game's packaging and the accompanying booklet.  However, the reviewer quickly changes their opinion, praising the game's addictive gameplay.  The game is described as a high-speed chase, similar to the arcade game ""Snakes"" or the movie/game ""Tron.""

The gameplay involves avoiding obstacles, collecting power-ups, and preventing other players from colliding with your trail.  The game features different play modes for single or multiplayer play, including against a computer opponent.

The review highlights several key aspects of the gameplay:

* **Trail-based movement:** Players leave a trail that other players cannot cross.  This is a crucial element of the game, forcing strategic thinking and preventing collisions.
* **Temporary doorways:**  The trail's pulsing square creates temporary ""doorways"" that allow players to cross their own trails or those of opponents.
* **Obstacles:**  The game includes boundary walls, solid bricks, and fuel nodes (power-ups).  Hitting these obstacles can lead to the player's demise.
* **Opponent interaction:**  Players must avoid colliding with other players' trails and use strategic maneuvers to box in opponents.
* **Level progression:**  Each level involves a grid-based playing area, and players must navigate through the level to complete it.
* **Control:** The game uses a joystick and an acceleration button for precise control of the tracer's movement.

**Review Critique:**

While praising the game's addictive nature and fast-paced gameplay, the reviewer does point out some minor criticisms:

* **Graphics:** The graphics are described as not particularly special.
* **Color differentiation:** Some colors are too similar, potentially causing players to misjudge obstacles.
* **Price:** The review notes that the £25 price point might seem steep for a game with relatively simple graphics.

**Overall Impression:**

Despite the minor criticisms, the reviewer concludes that the game's engaging gameplay, especially the satisfaction of successfully boxing in opponents, makes it a worthwhile experience.  The review emphasizes the enjoyment of the game, particularly the competitive aspect of the multiplayer modes.
