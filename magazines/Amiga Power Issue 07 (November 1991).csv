The reviewer also points out the game's inconsistent joystick controls, noting that the same joystick movement can have vastly different effects, leading to frustrating gameplay moments.  The reviewer also criticizes the game's difficulty in navigating the environment, particularly when the player is trying to avoid enemies or navigate narrow pathways.

**Level Design and Atmosphere:** The reviewer comments on the game's six levels, each themed around an element (earth, wind, water, fire, void, and limbo).  While acknowledging the effort put into the atmosphere and background, the reviewer criticizes the lack of character and detail in the levels themselves.

**Presentation and RPG Elements:** The review praises the game's presentation, including the movie-like intro sequence, striking music, and the chunky manual.

They point out that the control system can be frustrating, especially when the player is trying to navigate or fight enemies.

* **Rating:**  A single asterisk (*) is given, indicating a somewhat average or unremarkable game.
* **Description:** The review describes Tripppin as a board game-style game, but with a unique twist.  Players move their pieces on a grid, but the direction of movement is dictated by the opponent's position and changes randomly.  This makes strategy difficult to plan.

* **Description:** The review describes Crystal Caverns as a platformer, reminiscent of Steve Crow's 8-bit games.  However, the review criticizes the game's lack of content, noting that it's ""strangely involving for a while"" but quickly becomes boring due to a lack of enemies, objectives, and sound.  The review also notes the unusual use of expanded memory.

**4. Destination Moonbase (Start):**

* **Rating:** Two stars (**) are given, indicating a game with significant flaws.
* **Description:** The review describes Destination Moonbase as a Lunar Lander game, but with a simplified and less engaging design.  The review notes the game's resemblance to older arcade games, but criticizes the graphics and gameplay as being too simplistic and dated.

**5. Humdinger 41 (Telescan):**

* **Rating:** Three stars (***) are given, indicating a game of average quality.
