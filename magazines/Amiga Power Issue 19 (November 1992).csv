**Introduction:** The review begins with a concise summary of the game's details, including the publisher, author, price, and release date.  It then immediately sets a negative tone by highlighting the game's ""pitiful wire frame 3D graphics and tedious strategy-cum-simulation games.""

**Gameplay Overview:** The review delves into the game's mechanics, describing how the player controls various airborne and land-based military units, and manages a defense complex.
