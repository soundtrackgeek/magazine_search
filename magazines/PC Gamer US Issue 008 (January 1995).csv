34,"This page is an article from PC Gamer magazine, January 1995, titled ""Word to Your Mother! The quest for a kinder, gentler rating system.""  It discusses the emerging debate and development of voluntary rating systems for video games, specifically focusing on the Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC) and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB).

The article begins by highlighting the Congressional hearings on video game violence and the industry's efforts to create a universally accepted rating system.  It explains that two separate groups are working on this: RSAC and ESRB.

The RSAC, a non-profit organization established by the Software Publishing Association (SPA), is described as gaining acceptance.  The article notes that Robert Roden, general counsel for LucasArts, is the president of RSAC.  The RSAC system is explained as a voluntary program where developers answer specific questions about their games.  The ratings are scored from 0 to 4, with 0 being acceptable for all audiences and 4 being the highest level of violence, sex, or language.  The article also details the process of review, including the submission of game content and the scoring by independent reviewers.  A fee of $500 is associated with the submission, with a lower fee for smaller publishers.  The article emphasizes that the RSAC rating system is designed to inform consumers about the content of games.

The article also details the ESRB system, which is administered by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA).  It's headed by Dr. Arthur Pober, and the article highlights the involvement of industry giants like Electronic Arts, Sega, and Sony.  The ESRB system is described as using a similar structure to the movie industry's ratings, with categories like Early Childhood, Kids to Adults, Teen, Mature, and Adults Only.  The ESRB requires publishers to submit the most graphic portions of their games for review.  The article also mentions the fee structure for ESRB submissions and the possibility of appeals.

The article then discusses the potential impact of these rating systems on the gaming industry.  It suggests that the diversity and innovation in game design might be affected if developers prioritize higher ratings for increased sales.  It also notes that smaller publishers might exploit the rating system for publicity.  The article also touches on the potential for ratings to limit creativity, as developers might alter their games to avoid higher ratings.

The article concludes with a visual representation of the RSAC rating system, showing the different levels and descriptors for violence, nudity/sex, and language content.  It also includes a sample of the final verdict from the RSAC software.  Finally, the article raises the question of whether these new rating systems will ultimately benefit or harm the gaming industry and its consumers.  The article's overall tone is one of cautious optimism, acknowledging the potential benefits of a rating system while also highlighting the potential downsides. The review rating is not explicitly stated, but the article's tone suggests a neutral or slightly cautious perspective on the new rating systems.

147,"This page is an article from a computer gaming magazine, likely *PC Gamer*, discussing the merits of first-person versus third-person perspectives in role-playing games (RPGs).  The article is written by Neil Randall.

The article is structured as a review/opinion piece, not a traditional product review.  It doesn't review a specific game, but rather explores a broader theme within the RPG genre.

**Headline and Introduction:**

The headline, ""It's All in the Way You Look at It,"" immediately sets the stage for a discussion about perspective in RPGs. The introduction briefly explains the core concept of roleplaying, emphasizing the importance of character development and the story.

**Neil Randall's Argument:**

The article argues that while first-person perspective RPGs (FRPs) have become popular, third-person perspectives offer significant advantages in storytelling and plot development.  Randall points out that first-person games often focus too much on the immediate surroundings, potentially losing sight of the larger narrative.  He contrasts this with third-person games, which allow for a broader view of the characters and their interactions within the environment.

**Comparison of First-Person and Third-Person:**

The article meticulously compares the two perspectives.  It highlights how first-person FRPs often limit the player's view to the character's immediate surroundings, while third-person perspectives offer a more comprehensive view of the entire party and environment.  Randall argues that this broader perspective allows for more engaging and meaningful storytelling.

**Examples and Supporting Evidence:**

The article uses examples from various RPGs, both books and games, to illustrate its points.  It mentions *Ultima*, *Wizardry*, *Bard's Tale*, and *Dungeon Master* as examples of games that have used different perspectives.  It also discusses how the perspective choice affects the player's experience and the game's narrative.

**Debated Topic:**

The article explicitly states that the topic of first-person vs. third-person perspective is a frequently debated topic in the role-playing community.

**Conclusion:**

The conclusion summarizes the advantages of third-person perspective in RPGs, emphasizing its ability to create more engaging narratives and plot development.  Randall expresses a preference for third-person perspective, but acknowledges the popularity of first-person.

**Overall Rating (if applicable):**

There is no explicit rating given for any specific game or product.  The article is a discussion piece, not a review.
