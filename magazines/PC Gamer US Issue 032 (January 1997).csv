**Level 15: Swamp Fever**

The section describes the layout of Level 15, highlighting the close proximity of forts and the destroyed bridge between them.  Players are advised to control either the left or right side of the map to defend against the CPU's attacks.  The strategy emphasizes maintaining a strong defense in front of the fort while the CPU repairs the bridge and launches a direct attack across the river.  The recommended starting units are 3 Psychos, 1 Heavy Tank, 1 Med. Tank, and 1 Jeep.  The text also gives specific instructions on how to use the heavy tank to eliminate enemy units near the water's edge and capture flags to control territories.

**Level 16: Light Brigade**

This section details Level 16, emphasizing the heavily defended direct road between the forts.  Access is possible but difficult, requiring the player to remove defenses along the roads.  The CPU often launches a direct assault with a Heavy Tank, making it crucial to eliminate this unit as soon as possible.

The strategy involves moving the heavy tank to deter the CPU's attack and taking control of territories.

**Level 17: Car Park**

Tanks, 2 Lt. Tanks, and 1 Jeep.

**Level 18: Bridge Game**

The strategy guide for Level 18, ""Bridge Game,"" describes a battlefield with three bridges connecting two forts.  The forts are surrounded by areas containing factories and heavy unmanned hardware.  The CPU (computer player) is likely to send robots and vehicles across the bridges to attack.  The player is advised to keep at least one artillery unit in front of their fort to keep the bridges destroyed.  The player should split their forces to capture territories on both sides of the fort and use the crane to repair bridges.

**Level 19: Mayhem**

Level 19, ""Mayhem,"" features a large open battlefield surrounded by buildings and territories divided between the two sides.  The only way to reach the CPU fort is through the central territories, leading to a massive battle for resources.  The guide recommends raiding missions across the river from the top left and bottom right territories to gain an advantage.  The strategy involves moving robots and medium tanks up the left-hand road to control territories on the left side.  Medium tanks should be positioned at the road junction to repel CPU heavy tank assaults.  Troops should be sent along the bottom to pick up light tanks and use heavy tanks to defend the 3* tank factory territory.  The player should also send troops to collect hardware in the bottom left central territory and send heavy tanks to the bottom right central territory to hold the 5* tank factory.  The guide suggests alternative strategies, such as taking the other 5* tank factory.

**Level 20: Z**

Level 20, ""Z,"" is described as the final level, where everything is thrown at the player.  The initial layout is unusual, with many buildings close to the CPU and HCP forts.  The player must capture as many territories as possible to make factories effective.  Capturing the Mobile Missile Launcher and Heavy Tank in either the top left or bottom right of the map is crucial for winning.

230,"This page is a review of the video game ""Syndicate Wars,"" published in PC Gamer magazine, January 1997.

The review is structured as a feature article, highlighting various aspects of the game.  It begins with an introductory paragraph about the game's theme of personal destruction and global conquest.

The review then details several weapons and features of the game, including:

* **Razor Wire:** A nearly invisible anti-personnel device useful for traps.
* **Electron Mace:** A devastating weapon that delivers 10,000-volt shocks.
* **Cerberus IFF:** A lightweight, portable sentry system with a laser turret.

* **Nuclear Grenade:** A powerful, localized nuclear device capable of leveling buildings.
* **Plasma Lance:** A weapon that roasts victims with white-hot plasma.

The review also discusses the game's gameplay mechanics, including:

* **Gameplay:** The game allows players to choose between the EuroCorp syndicate or The Church of the New Epoch, each with different weapons and objectives.  Multi-player options are also available.
* **Graphics:** The review notes a shift from the isometric perspective of the original to a fully polygonal 3D world.  However, the graphics are described as ""ugly"" in standard 320x200 mode, with jagged, unrefined polygonal characters and grainy textures.  The graphics improve significantly in 640x480 Super VGA mode, but the game can be sluggish on lower-end machines.
* **Interface:** The interface is described as simple, mouse-driven, with few changes from the original.  New keyboard commands control the zoom, tilt, and rotation of the environment.
* **Missions:** The review points out a lack of mission variety, with players repeating essentially three missions: kill everything, capture someone, or kill everything and capture someone.  While the difficulty increases, the limited nature of the missions makes the experience repetitive.
* **Gameplay Experience:** The review describes the game as a bone-crunching, lead-slinging good time, with an exciting mix of down-and-dirty, real-time action and cyberpunk-style thrills.

The review concludes with a ""Final Verdict"" section, giving the game an 88% rating.  The review highlights the demanding real-time action, dark and moody atmosphere, and the awe-inspiring weapons.  However, it also points out the dark graphics and limited mission variety as drawbacks.  The bottom line is that fans of the original Syndicate will find much to enjoy in this revamp, but should be prepared for a new world order.

233,"This page is a review of the video game ""Bedlam,"" published in PC Gamer magazine.

**Review Summary:**

The review gives ""Bedlam"" a 68% rating.  While praising the game's action-packed nature, lots of explosions, and easy control, the reviewer criticizes the lack of variety in gameplay, the tedious search for switches and triggers, and the enemies being too easy to kill.  The reviewer also notes the lack of a multiplayer mode.

**Game Overview (from the review):**

The game is a first-person shooter-style game with an isometric perspective.  Players control a three-man R.A.T. (Remote Assault Tank) team on a mission to clear out human installations overrun by monsters called Biomex.  The game involves 25 missions, each requiring players to navigate danger-filled levels, destroy objectives, and reach extraction points.

**Gameplay Details (from the review):**

* **Action and Explosions:** The game is described as having plenty of action and lots of explosions.
* **Controlling Units:**  Controlling the units is easy, using the left mouse button to move and the right to shoot, similar to other games.
* **Weapon Selection:** Players can select multiple weapons using number keys and switch between R.A.T. units using function keys.
* **Map Design:** The map is refreshingly large, allowing for exploration.
* **Beacon System:**  Players must find a reddish beacon to be extracted by a dropship.  The placement of these beacons and the need to activate switches and elevators to reach them are a key part of the gameplay.
* **Electric Fences:**  To progress, players must find deactivation switches for electric fences.  The reviewer notes this as a major problem, as the game becomes tedious with aimless wandering and back-and-forth searching for switches.
* **Enemy Difficulty:**  The enemies are described as easy to kill, requiring only one or two shots to defeat.  This, combined with the need to conserve ammo, makes the challenge of the game less about action and more about conserving ammo and finding switches.
* **Key-Hunt Levels:** The reviewer notes the ""sprawling key-hunt levels"" as a significant drawback, making the game less fun.

**Review Sections:**

The page contains a review of the game, including a summary of the game's features and the reviewer's opinion.  There are also visual elements, including screenshots of the game's interface and gameplay.

**Game Overview:**

The article describes ""Virtua Squad"" as a coin-op conversion, meaning it's a port of a game originally designed for arcade machines.  It's a gun-based game, similar to ""Virtua Cop,"" but re-named for the PC release due to internal Sega issues.  The review notes that the game is essentially a ""by-the-numbers"" gun game, but the conversion is technically impressive.

**Review Details:**

The review, written by Gary Whitta, gives the game a 70% rating.  The review highlights both positive and negative aspects:

* **Positives:**  The game is fast, fluid, and frenetic, mirroring the arcade experience.  The graphics are described as remarkable.  The game is technically well-executed, especially if the player has a fast computer.  The action is broken down into three difficulty zones.  The game offers a good amount of fun in the early stages, particularly visually.  The option for two-player simultaneous play is mentioned as a positive.

* **Negatives:** The review criticizes the game's limited content, with only three levels that can be completed quickly.  The conversion, while technically good, lacks the visceral feel of the arcade original, particularly in terms of the gun-based control method.  The game is described as ""somewhat sanitized"" and the fun is diluted without the arcade's vibrating gun.  The review also notes that the game's entertainment value might not last long.

**Technical Specifications and Requirements:**

**Target Audience:**

The review suggests that the game is likely to appeal to younger gamers due to its fast-paced action and lack of graphic violence.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The review concludes that ""Virtua Squad"" is an entertaining diversion, but its limited content and lack of the arcade's visceral feel might lead to the game becoming outdated quickly.  The review recommends the game for players who enjoy fast-paced action games and are looking for a competent ""twitch"" game.

**Review Content:**

The review begins with a description of the game's 3D terrain and resource management aspects.  The reviewer notes the difficulty in assigning research points and the first-come, first-served nature of the system.  They also criticize the complexity of managing multiple cities and the game's tendency to become overwhelming.

Hire-a-Gov allows players to hire a governor to manage mundane tasks like feeding, housing, and education, freeing up the player to focus on other aspects of the game.

It's compared to Disney's *Roger Rabbit*, but criticized for lacking originality despite its substantial budget ($6 million).  The reviewer highlights the game's large amount of content but notes that the creativity doesn't match the resources invested.

**Gameplay and Story:**

The review emphasizes the game's cartoonish style, drawing inspiration from classic cartoon history, particularly *Who Framed Roger Rabbit*.  The protagonist, a struggling cartoonist named Drew Blanc, is tasked with solving a series of puzzles and challenges in a cartoon world.  The game features a mix of point-and-click adventure elements, cinematic sequences (FMV), and mini-games.  The reviewer notes that the story is predictable and relies on clichÃ©s, but the puzzles are generally clever and intuitive.  The game is divided into two acts, with the first focusing on collecting items and the second on more complex puzzles.

It suggests the game relies too heavily on tired cartoon tropes and lacks a genuine creative spark.  The review points out that the game's attempts at humor often fall flat, and the game's ""twisted"" theme, while intended to be unique, ultimately feels predictable and uninspired.  The reviewer notes that the game feels like a mass-produced Saturday morning cartoon, lacking the originality and creativity of other successful cartoon-inspired games.
