* **Ups:** The game is described as ""Beguilingly complex puzzle game in the Lemmings mould, but without any of the gruesomely annoying mess/pedantry faults.""

They also appreciate the 3D elements, even if they are simple.  The reviewer notes the ""extremely fast engine"" and ""fantastic control system"" and the ""spooky monsters.""

* **Negatives:**  The reviewer criticizes the ""dumb pass code system"" that makes restarting from later levels difficult.  They also point out the ""moronic oversight"" of the ammo packs, which are only available for purchase, not earned.  The reviewer highlights the ""featureless mazes"" and the ""blank-walled mazes"" as a major problem, leading to disorientation and frustration.  The ""code system"" is described as ""fatally flawed,"" and the ""start/stop pace"" of the game is deemed ""tedious.""  The reviewer notes that the game's technical limitations, such as a lack of screen detail, make later levels a chore.

**Game Mechanics Description:** The review details the game's basic gameplay loop: picking up weapons, ammo, keys, and security passes to navigate the maze-like levels, finding a bomb, and escaping.  The reviewer emphasizes the importance of finding the exit quickly, as the maze's design and the bomb's activation time create a sense of urgency.  The reviewer also notes the importance of the food to maintain strength.

**Specific Level Details:** The review mentions level one as an easy exit, but later levels are described as having a 30-second time limit to navigate the maze.
