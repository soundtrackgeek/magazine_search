15,"This page is an article from a magazine, likely *Amiga Format*, about the influence of films and television on computer games.  The title of the article is ""Moviedrome,"" and it's written by Gordon Houghton.

The article is formatted with a large, bold headline ""Moviedrome"" in a green color, and a smaller subtitle below it that reads ""Films and television have long exerted an influence on computer games. GORDON HOUGHTÎÎ attempts to divine the reasons...""

The article features several images, likely screenshots or promotional art, of various films and video games.  These images are small and are interspersed throughout the text.  The images depict scenes from movies like RoboCop, a scene from a fantasy film, and a scene from a science fiction film.  There are also images of arcade games and computer games.

The article itself discusses how films and television have influenced the design and development of computer games.  The author, Gordon Houghton, argues that incorporating elements from films, such as specific scenes, concepts, or even entire storylines, can give a game a unique ""mystical quality"" that sets it apart from other games.  He uses the term ""implant a sub-conscious set of film references"" to describe this process.

The article also touches on the idea that games set in synthetic worlds, like science fiction or fantasy, might not resonate as strongly with players as games that draw on familiar film references.  The author suggests that incorporating film references can give a game a unique edge over its competitors.

A quote from the article is highlighted, emphasizing the author's point about the importance of film references in game design.  The quote reads: ""Implant a sub-conscious set of film references into a game and it gains a mystical quality which gives it the edge.""

The page also includes a footer that indicates the publication details, ""AMIGA FORMAT 15."" This suggests the article is part of a larger magazine issue.

"
16,"This page is an article, likely from a magazine, discussing the influence of films on video games, specifically on Amiga games.  The article is broken down into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of this influence.

**Stealing the Scene:** This section argues that programmers often directly incorporate elements from films into their games, using plot points, character names, and even visual styles.  It highlights how the association with a popular film can enhance a game's appeal, but also notes that sometimes this direct copying can lead to mediocre results if the game's mechanics aren't strong enough.  The author uses examples like *Star Wars* to illustrate this point.

**More Subtlety:** This section delves into more subtle influences, arguing that films can inspire games in less obvious ways.  It suggests that games can draw inspiration from the atmosphere, plot elements, or even the general feel of a film, without necessarily replicating specific scenes or characters.  The author emphasizes that this indirect influence can be just as important as direct copying.

**The Real Thing:** This section discusses the use of film licenses in games.  It notes that while using licensed material can be beneficial, it can also lead to games that are overly focused on violence or conflict, potentially lacking depth or originality.  The author also mentions the trend of converting popular films into games, using examples like *Licence to Kill*, *Batman*, *Ghostbusters 2*, and *Indy III*.

**Xenophobia:** This section explores how themes and ideas from science fiction films, particularly those dealing with invasion or rebellion, can influence game plots.  It argues that these themes can be a significant source of inspiration for game developers, but also notes that the influence might not always be easily quantifiable.

The article also includes smaller sections with specific examples, such as a discussion of the James Bond game and its relation to the film *The Spy Who Loved Me*.  There's also a section about the *Splarg monster* from a game, which is presented as an example of a game drawing inspiration from a film's plot.

The overall tone of the article is analytical and informative, discussing the various ways in which films and video games interact and influence each other.  It's not a simple review, but rather an exploration of a creative relationship.  There's no explicit review rating given.

**Review Content:**

The review begins with a description of the game's premise and gameplay mechanics.  It emphasizes the simplicity of the objective: surviving as long as possible by collecting and arranging colored tiles in the bins.  The reviewer explains the concept of ""Klaxes"" (three or more tiles of the same color arranged vertically, horizontally, or diagonally), which cause those tiles to disappear, creating more space.  The game is played in waves, each with a specific objective (e.g., creating three diagonal Klaxes, or reaching 10,000 points).  The reviewer highlights the difficulty increasing as the game progresses, with faster-moving tiles and more colors.  The use of a tile catcher is explained, allowing players to control the falling tiles and strategically place them in the bins.

**Review Details:**

The review, which appears under the heading ""JUDGEMENT,"" gives the game an overall score of 79%.  The reviewer praises the well-structured skill levels, noting that while it takes time to master the amateur level, players will want more control and will want to progress to higher levels.  However, the reviewer criticizes the graphics, stating that they are a significant drawback, and that the game, while playable, doesn't quite match up to the quality of other tennis games like Ubi Soft's Pro Tennis Tour.  The reviewer concludes that it's a decent game but not quite as good as the competition.

127,"This page is a technical article, likely from a computer magazine, discussing the programming of a game called ""The Guardian,"" part of a larger game series called ""Menace.""  It's part of a series called ""The Whole Truth About Games Programming,"" and this is part 7.

The article details the graphics and code used to create the guardian character in the game.  It explains how the game's developers used a compression method to reduce the amount of memory required to store the graphics.

**Specific details:**

* **Compression Method:** The article describes a compression technique where zero values in the image data are flagged, and only the non-zero data is stored.  This is done by scanning each plane of the image, and if all three planes are empty, a single bit is set to flag this.  If any plane contains data, a bit is set to flag this, and the data is copied to the compressed file.  This method is described as a ""bitmap header"" and is said to roughly halve the size of the guardian data.

* **Guardian Structure:** The guardian is composed of multiple planes of data, and the article explains how these planes are handled during compression.

* **Graphics Representation:** The article shows pixel-art images of the guardian from different levels of the game.  These images are used to illustrate the compression method and the structure of the guardian.

* **Animation:** The article discusses how the animation of the guardian is handled, noting that the classic R-Type game used a similar technique, where only parts of the guardian are animated.

* **Memory Efficiency:** The article emphasizes the importance of memory efficiency in game development, explaining why the compression method is necessary to store the guardian's graphics.

* **Technical Details:** The article provides specific technical details about the image dimensions (256x192 pixels), the number of bytes used, and the compression method.

**Overall:** The article is aimed at programmers and game developers, providing insights into the technical aspects of game creation.  It's not a general review of the game itself, but rather a deep dive into the programming techniques used to create a specific character.  There's no explicit review rating.
