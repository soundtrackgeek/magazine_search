**Review 1: Phantasm**

* **Rating:**  Implied as ""decent, if overpriced"" or ""good indeed"" but not overwhelmingly positive.
* **Description:**  A shoot 'em up game where the player pilots a spaceship. The review notes the game's music is good, but the graphics are less attractive compared to other games.  The gameplay is described as fairly predictable, with a 3D effect that's minimal and somewhat slow-paced.  The selection of an attack quadrant from a map is a unique feature.

* **Developer:** Exocet Software
* **Price:** £19.95


**Review 2: Football Manager 2**

* **Rating:**  Positive, but with caveats.  The reviewer calls it ""addictive"" and highlights the depth of the training section.
* **Description:**  A football management simulation game. The review praises the ease of use of the menu-driven system, but criticizes the mouse controls as overly sensitive in the player positioning section.

The graphics are described as ""OK"" for their purpose, but could have been better.  The reviewer emphasizes the game's depth, particularly in the training section, which will appeal to strategy gamers.
