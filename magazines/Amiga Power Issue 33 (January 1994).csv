The review describes ""Suburban Commando"" as a game with a mix of genres: shoot-'em-up, beat-'em-up, and platformer elements.  The core gameplay revolves around platforming sections, but these are interspersed with other game modes.  The review highlights that the majority of the game is focused on the platforming aspects, which is considered a wise design choice.

The review points out that the game's controls, particularly the jumping mechanics, are somewhat awkward.
