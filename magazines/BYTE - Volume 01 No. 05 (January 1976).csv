Crucially, the description emphasizes that each post (except the first and last) receives two wraps: one at a lower level and one above it.  The method is described as starting at one end and connecting posts sequentially until the last connection is made.  The text highlights a significant disadvantage of this method: if a connection needs to be removed, it requires removing multiple wraps, potentially causing a cascade of problems throughout the chain.  The example given is removing a connection between two posts, requiring the removal of multiple wraps.  The text suggests a ""dummy wrap"" as a workaround to avoid the cascade effect.  The accompanying photograph shows the setup of the wire wraps on a grid-like surface.

**Photo 9:** This section introduces an alternative chaining method designed to minimize the propagation of changes.  The method is described as highly recommended for initial wiring of buses with more than four posts.  The key principle is connecting wires at the same wrap level at each end.  The text explains that if a change is needed at a higher level, only one wire needs to be removed, unlike the previous method where multiple wraps are affected.  The method is described as connecting all possible pairs of posts at the first level, then connecting the remaining post (if any) to a pair at the second level.  The text distinguishes between buses with an even and odd number of posts, explaining how the method handles each case.  The text also notes that this method is best for initial wiring and that later changes might necessitate a hybrid approach combining the two techniques.  The accompanying photograph shows a different arrangement of wire wraps on the grid-like surface, illustrating the alternative method.

The page's overall focus is on efficient and effective methods for connecting multiple wire wrap posts in a chain-like configuration, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches.  The review rating is not present on the page.

62,"This page contains an article titled ""Taking Advantage of Memory Address Space"" by James Luscher.  The article discusses the concept of address spaces in computers, contrasting them with the physical memory.

The author explains that a computer's address space isn't necessarily the same as the amount of memory installed.  The address space is defined by the instruction set design and represents the set of addressable data locations.  The article points out that thinking in terms of address spaces is more useful than thinking in terms of memory blocks because address spaces don't need identical physical implementations at each location, and there can be multiple address spaces in a computer.

The article further elaborates on different types of address spaces:

* **Non-Memory Address Spaces:**  These address spaces aren't directly tied to main memory.  The author uses the Intel 8008's `ADr` (add register to accumulator) instruction and `INP` (input) instruction as examples.  These instructions have address fields that specify registers or input ports, which are not part of the main memory.

* **Non-Uniform Address Spaces:**  These address spaces don't have a uniform structure like main memory.  The author uses the Intel 8008's `ADr` instruction again to illustrate this.  While the instruction uses 3 bits to specify 8 possible register locations, only 7 registers are actually available.  The eighth location has a different function.

The article emphasizes the importance of careful consideration of all address spaces in computer design.  The author highlights that designers need to account for the cost of unused address space, which can manifest as extra bits in instructions or memory.  The article concludes by stating that determining how to handle addressing various functional elements in a computer is a crucial design issue.

The page is formatted with clear headings, paragraphs, and numbered lists where appropriate.  The text is dense with technical details, making it suitable for a technical audience.  There's no review rating present on the page.
