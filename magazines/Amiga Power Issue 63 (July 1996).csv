"
28,"This page is an article from ""The Journal of Retired Generals and Discerning Bayonet Collectors,"" likely a historical magazine, focusing on the Battle of Rorke's Drift, which took place in January 1879.

The article begins with a brief overview of the Battle of Isandhlwana, a previous engagement, and then moves to the Battle of Rorke's Drift.  It acknowledges that Rorke's Drift was a smaller engagement than Isandhlwana but still significant.  The article highlights the historical importance of the battle and the participation of British forces under Queen Victoria.

The article then discusses the 1964 film *Zulu*, which depicts the battle.  It notes the roles of Michael Caine and Stanley Baker in the film, and the portrayal of the battle.  The article also includes a critical review of the film's portrayal of the battle, noting that while the film highlights the bravery of individual soldiers, it may not accurately portray the true grit and superior fighting prowess of the British soldiers.  It also criticizes the film's portrayal of the Zulu warriors, suggesting that the film diminishes the glory and heroism of the defenders.

The article includes a ""Tactics Review"" section, written by Terry Venables, a football manager and military strategist.  Venables analyzes the Zulu attack, questioning why the attack failed despite the Zulu's numerical advantage.  He suggests that the Zulu attack's failure was due to uninspired tactics and a lack of exploiting opportunities.

"
29,"This page is from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, and is a feature article titled ""Bloody Good Games? Too Bloody Right.""  The article, dated July 1996, is a humorous and somewhat sarcastic critique of the idea that Michael Caine movies are somehow linked to Amiga games.

The article begins with a bold headline and a short introductory paragraph that sets the tone for the piece.  It argues against the preposterous notion that there's a connection between the two.

The body of the article presents a series of examples.  For each example, it pairs a Michael Caine film with an Amiga game, claiming that there's no logical connection.  The examples are presented in a list format, with each pairing accompanied by a humorous, often sarcastic, quote from someone who supposedly believes in the connection.  The quotes are designed to be humorous and dismissive of the idea.

The article also includes screenshots or images of Amiga games and movie posters.  These visuals are used to illustrate the points being made in the text.

The article's tone is lighthearted and satirical.  It's not a serious review of the games or movies, but rather a humorous piece that pokes fun at the idea of a connection between the two.

The article also includes a section where the authors state that they have mentioned five good Michael Caine films with obvious links to Amiga games, but they haven't mentioned others, like *Alfie* (1966), *Mona Lisa* (1986), *Funeral In Berlin* (1967), *The Ipcress File* (1965), or *Educating Rita* (1983).  They point out that these films are good, but there are no Amiga games that can be linked to them.  This further emphasizes the article's satirical nature.

The article concludes with a final, humorous statement, ""And we are NEVER WRONG.""  This reinforces the satirical tone and the authors' position that there is no connection between Michael Caine movies and Amiga games.

The overall review rating, if you can call it that, is implicitly negative.  The article is clearly not endorsing the idea of a connection and is actively arguing against it.  The tone is not one of critical analysis but rather one of playful dismissal.

**Games 8 Review:**

* **Rating:**  The review gives the game three stars (âââ).
* **Summary:** The reviewer played seven games on Gilbo's Games, but mistakenly reviewed Games 8.  The reviewer notes that it's the eighth edition in a series of compilations and contains only three games.  The game is based on the Disney film Tron, requiring the player to steer a rasterbike through a black background, shooting opponents.  The reviewer describes the game as ""cool"" and mentions the availability of three weapons, costing between 2 and 1000 credits.  The effectiveness of the weapons increases with price, and more credits are earned based on time spent alive and opponents killed.
* **Specifics:** The reviewer mentions the game's initial confusion, but that it grew on them.  They also highlight the ten-player mode, requiring two four-player adaptors, as a noteworthy feature.  The review also suggests that players who haven't played Knockout or Breed 96 should check out previous issues 60 and 61 of the magazine or buy the compilation to experience Mega Tron.

**Chicken Run Review:**

* **Rating:** The review gives the game one star (â).
* **Summary:** The reviewer describes the game as a ""pointless display of ineptness"" and a ""not particularly difficult version of Frogger.""  The game involves controlling a character named Darryl who has to navigate the M11 while dodging cars.  The reviewer criticizes the single level and the focus on guiding hedgehogs across the road, calling it a ""big deal"" bonus.  The game's power-ups, which increase speed and provide more lives, are also criticized as not being a sufficient incentive.
* **Specifics:** The reviewer highlights the difficulty of the game as being in the ""danger of falling off"" a line between good and bad PD games.  The reviewer states that the game is only one level and that the real challenge is looking after the hedgehogs.  The reviewer also mentions that the game is relatively easy to get Darryl across the road safely.

**Splat Review:**

* **Rating:** The review gives the game four stars (ââââ).
* **Summary:** The reviewer describes Splat as a Breakout-style game, but more friendly than Inersex.  The game involves a crab paddle navigating an ocean bed with fish, and a bubble that randomly deflects the ball.  The game has 50 levels with different fish to defeat.  The reviewer notes that the game is enjoyable for fans of Breakout games, but that the bonuses, such as a megaball and magnetic force, are often useless due to the ball's original speed.
* **Specifics:** The reviewer highlights the game's friendly nature compared to Inersex, mentioning the absence of ""naked women.""  They also praise the 50 levels and the variety of fish.  The reviewer concludes by stating that the game has convinced them that Breakout games remain a popular genre of PD games.
