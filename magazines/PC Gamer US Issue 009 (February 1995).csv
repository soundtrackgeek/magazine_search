The review, written by Todd Vaughn, gives the game a score of 61%.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing the game as an arcade action game, developed by Electronic Arts and published by Gremlin Interactive.  It's a PC game, and the reviewer notes that it's based on a Sega Genesis cartridge game.  The game is set in a war-torn Middle Eastern region, and the player controls an Apache helicopter.

**Review Content:**

The review is structured into several sections, discussing various aspects of the game:

* **Graphics and Sound:** The reviewer notes that the graphics are decent, but the sound effects are mediocre.  The primitive graphics and sounds are compared to earlier, less sophisticated games.

* **Gameplay Mechanics:** The reviewer criticizes the control scheme, calling it ""ticklish.""  The view shifting, especially when targeting, is described as annoying and leading to frequent deaths.  The need to cycle through weapons using the spacebar, instead of dedicated buttons, is also a point of contention.  The limited view of the terrain and the mediocre sound effects are also mentioned as drawbacks.

* **Story and Mission Design:** The reviewer finds the storyline simplistic and juvenile, comparing it to a mix of the Persian Gulf War and the Rambo movies.  The missions are described as varied, but the overall story is a significant weakness.

* **Positive Aspects:** Despite the criticisms, the reviewer acknowledges some positive elements, such as the fun of rescuing downed pilots and the strategic elements of refueling and gathering ammo.

* **Overall Verdict:** The reviewer concludes that while the graphics are decent, the childish story, ticklish controls, and annoying sound effects make the game a poor choice for PC gamers.  The reviewer suggests that if the player was unsure about purchasing a PC game versus a cartridge-based game, this title would likely convince them to choose the cartridge.

However, the reviewer also points out that the puzzles, while varied, don't offer much replay value.

**Review of Reader Rabbit's Interactive Reading Journey:**

The review, written by Heidi E. H. Aycock, gives a detailed look at the program's features and educational design.  The reviewer praises the program's interactive approach, combining reading drills with the context of stories.  Instead of focusing solely on isolated word recognition, the program connects words to the narrative, making learning more engaging.  The reviewer highlights the program's simple yet effective drills, suitable for beginning readers.  The program's use of repetition and gradual introduction of new words is also noted as a positive aspect.

The article also mentions the program's colorful graphics and friendly, clear speaking voices.  The reviewer specifically notes the ability to click on black-and-white line drawings to reveal color illustrations, which is a visually engaging feature.  However, a minor criticism is the ""dubbed-foreign-film syndrome"" where the characters' lip movements don't always perfectly match the audio.

**Overall Assessment:**

The review concludes that the program is a valuable tool for children interested in learning to read, particularly for a formal learning approach.  The reviewer emphasizes the program's well-designed teaching method, rather than the literary merit of the stories themselves.  The price point of $99 is also mentioned, suggesting that the program's value lies in its educational approach rather than the stories' inherent quality.

**Other Sections:**

The page also includes a general introduction to the ""Learning Game"" section of the magazine, highlighting the latest trends in educational software.

135,"This page is an article from PC Gamer magazine, February 1995, titled ""Caching It In.""  The article discusses caching, a technique used to speed up data access in computers.

The article begins by explaining the different types of memory in a PC, highlighting the speed and scarcity of cache RAM, and the abundance and slower speed of hard disk space.  It describes the memory hierarchy, from the fastest internal cache RAM on the CPU chip to slower external cache RAM on the motherboard, system RAM, hard disk, and CD-ROM drives.  The author explains how caches work by using a smaller, faster memory to store frequently accessed data, making it seem like the slower memory is faster.  The article emphasizes the concept of ""locality of reference,"" where programs tend to access the same data repeatedly.

The article then delves into the specifics of CD-ROM caching.  It discusses how CD-ROMs, while offering large storage capacity, are relatively slow compared to RAM.  The article introduces a dedicated CD-ROM cache program, D-Time10, which can use both RAM and hard disk space to cache CD-ROM data.  It explains how D-Time10 uses a ""timelog"" to track data access patterns and optimize caching decisions for specific games.  The article also touches on how to improve hardware RAM caching by adding more cache memory chips or using larger hard drives.

The article concludes by emphasizing that caching can significantly improve system performance, especially for CD-ROMs, and that software caches are often more customizable than hardware caches.  It also mentions that cache programs are generally available at a lower price than hardware solutions.

The overall tone of the article is informative and technical, aimed at computer users who want to understand and optimize their systems.  There's no explicit review rating, but the article presents information about different caching techniques and software.

139,"This page is from a February 1995 issue of PC Gamer magazine, featuring an article titled ""Your Turn, Folks.""  The article is a column, likely a regular feature, focusing on reader feedback and discussion about role-playing games (RPGs).

The column begins with a section where the author addresses reader emails and messages.  These messages are about technical issues with PC games, requests for help with specific game mechanics, and general feedback on the RPG genre.  The author highlights the frustration of some readers with the limitations of computer RPGs compared to pen-and-paper RPGs, and the desire for more player agency and freedom in the games.

The author then transitions to a discussion of reader suggestions for role-playing scenarios.  Several readers express interest in playing non-traditional characters, such as goblins or ogres, and not just the typical heroes.  The author explores the reasons why this is often not possible in computer RPGs, contrasting them with the flexibility of pen-and-paper RPGs.

The article then features a section where the author interviews or quotes other individuals, including Neil Randall, who discusses the desire for more complex and nuanced role-playing experiences in RPGs.
