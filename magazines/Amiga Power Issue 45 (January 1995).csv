* **Release Date:** Out now (January 1995)

**Review Summary (Kenneth More):**

The review gives a mixed assessment of *Powerdrive*.  While the game's concept of a fast-paced, world-driving arcade game is intriguing, the reviewer criticizes the controls as initially awkward and prone to skidding.  The reviewer highlights the game's frustrating mechanic of losing money and performance after crashes, creating a vicious cycle where the player struggles to maintain their vehicle and progress.  The reviewer notes that the game's financial system is overly punishing, and the gameplay becomes repetitive and unmotivating.  The reviewer also points out that the game's controls, while initially difficult, become manageable with practice.  The reviewer's overall impression is that the game, despite its potential, ultimately fails to be engaging or fun due to its frustrating financial and gameplay mechanics.

**Game Description (from the review):**

* **Controls:** The controls are described as ""weird"" and prone to causing the car to skid and slide.  The reviewer emphasizes the importance of learning to control the car gently to avoid crashes.
* **Financial System:**  The game's financial system is a significant point of criticism.  The player loses money after crashes, which in turn reduces the car's performance and makes it harder to win.  This creates a cycle where the player struggles to maintain their vehicle and progress.
* **Vehicle Selection:** The game features six cars, but only a Fiat Cinquecento and a Mini are available at the start.

**Other Information:**

* **Technical Details:** The page includes information about the game's technical specifications, such as the platforms it runs on.

The article describes Mission 28 as a ""frustrating"" area with a Watchdog, Cobras, and a garage with friendly personnel.  The author notes that AAMs are ineffective against the Watchdog due to its proximity to the garage, and rockets are imprecise.

**Mission 24 (Hippodome):**

The article explains Mission 24, highlighting the ""Hippo"" as the key to the mission.  The walkthrough emphasizes the importance of using the Hippo to destroy the dome, which contains another Buffalo.  The Buffalo, once released from the dome, is not targeted by the enemy, allowing it to roam freely and destroy enemy units.  The strategy involves positioning the Hippo for effective shots, ducking behind the dome for protection, and using the Buffalo to clear the area.

The page's layout is clear, with visuals and text combined to guide the reader through the game's mechanics and strategies.  The review rating is not explicitly stated, but the tone suggests a positive assessment of the game's gameplay and the walkthrough's effectiveness.

114,"This page is a vintage article, likely from a gaming magazine, discussing the influence of film directors on the design of the video game *Mortal Kombat 4*.  It's a detailed look at how the game's developers drew inspiration from various directors' styles for the ""finishing moves"" of the characters.

The layout is organized into several sections, each focusing on a different director and their corresponding ""finishing move"" as depicted in the game.  Each section features a small image or collage of film stills, likely from movies directed by the featured filmmaker, overlaid with a stylized image of a *Mortal Kombat* character performing the move.  The text describes the move in terms of directional inputs (e.g., ""Left, Left, Down, Left, Right a bit, Fire"").

The article highlights the creative process behind the game's design, emphasizing the unusual collaboration between video game developers and film directors.  It notes that the developers had to wait for advancements in video compression technology to fully realize their vision.

The article also mentions the research involved in recreating the film directors' styles in the game, including the use of ""exhaustive research"" and ""design roughs"" to capture the essence of the moves.  It also mentions a ""character new to the game"" called ""Boffo.""

There's a section titled ""BABALITY!"" with a corresponding image, and another section titled ""FINISH EACH OTHER!"" with a description of various finishing moves inspired by different directors.

The overall tone is informative and enthusiastic, showcasing the creative process behind the game's development.  The review rating is not explicitly stated, but the article's focus on the creative process and the detailed descriptions of the moves suggest a positive assessment of the game's design choices.
