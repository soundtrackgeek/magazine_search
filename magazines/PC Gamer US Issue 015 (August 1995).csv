85,"This page is a review of the PC game ""Iron Assault,"" published in PC Gamer magazine in August 1995.

The review, written by Scott Wolf, gives the game a final verdict score of 74%.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing ""Iron Assault"" as a robot combat simulation, similar to other games in the genre, but not significantly different from its predecessors.  It notes that the game's core gameplay, whether you call the robots ""Mechs, Bots, or Hercs,"" remains essentially the same as other games in the genre.  The reviewer highlights that the game doesn't offer much that distinguishes it from other games in the genre.  At best, it's a slightly less polished version of a game like EarthSiege, and at worst, it's as confusing as some other games in the genre.

**Technical Specifications and Requirements:**

The page lists the required hardware and software for running the game, including: 486/33 processor, 4 MB RAM, 3 MB EMS, DOS 5.0, 256-color VGA, a mouse, a CD-ROM drive, and 3 MB of hard drive space.  It also specifies the recommended joystick, rudder pedals, and sound blaster compatible card.

**Gameplay and Missions:**

The review describes the gameplay as involving missions that take players through various environments, including cities, deserts, mountains, and arctic terrain.  The ultimate goal is to reclaim the world for democracy.  Players are briefed on objectives, select and arm their machines, and are then dropped into the combat zone.  The reviewer notes that the desert, mountain, and frozen wasteland scenarios are visually unappealing, with primitive animations and murky environments.  However, the city scenarios are described as more enjoyable, especially in multiplayer mode, where players navigate the streets of Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia, causing collateral damage to buildings and vehicles.  The reviewer emphasizes the importance of using the in-game map, waypoints, and radio communication to control the movements of the player's squadron.

**Review Highlights and Low Points:**

The review highlights the game's ease of management and its fun for two players in city scenarios.  However, it criticizes the primitive enemy animations and the ill-conceived play areas as significant weaknesses.

**Overall Impression:**

The reviewer concludes that while ""Iron Assault"" isn't a bad game, it doesn't stand out as a particularly innovative or memorable entry in the robot combat genre.  The reviewer suggests that players who enjoy the concept of controlling large, walking robots might find the game enjoyable, but it's not a game that will revolutionize the genre.  The review also implies that the game would have been a better Amiga game, highlighting the strengths of that platform's capabilities.

**Additional Information:**

The page includes screenshots of the game's interface and gameplay, showing the various units, maps, and options available to the player.  The screenshots also show the game's graphics, which are described as primitive in some areas.

93,"This page is a review of the PC game ""Blood Bowl,"" published in PC Gamer magazine, August 1995.

The review is presented in a standard layout for a game review, with a prominent ""Final Verdict"" score of 71%.

**Review Summary:** The reviewer, Dan Bennett, finds the PC version of ""Blood Bowl"" to be a faithful adaptation of the popular board game, but ultimately lacking in several key areas. While the concept and design are praised, the artificial intelligence (AI) is criticized for being slow and predictable.  A significant complaint is the lack of promised modem support for remote play, which is a significant omission given the game's presentation.  The reviewer notes that the game's turn-based nature, while true to the board game, can lead to extended periods of waiting for the computer opponent to make moves.  The instant replay feature and occasional announcer commentary are highlighted as positive additions, but these are not enough to compensate for the game's shortcomings.

**Game Overview:** The review describes ""Blood Bowl"" as a strategy game set in the Warhammer universe, similar to football but with fantasy elements like orcs and elves.  The game involves controlling players in a turn-based format, with the goal of carrying a ball into the opponent's end zone.  The review emphasizes the game's violent and strategic nature, drawing parallels to Australian Rules Football.  The review also highlights the game's simulation aspects, such as player statistics, substitutions, and coaching.

**Technical Specifications and Requirements:** The page lists the required hardware specifications for running the game, including the minimum processor speed, RAM, hard drive space, and sound card.

**Gameplay Details:** The review details the gameplay mechanics, emphasizing the turn-based nature and the computer opponent's sometimes lengthy decision-making process.  The review also mentions the instant replay feature and the occasional commentary as positive aspects.

**Comparison to the Board Game:** The review explicitly compares the PC version to the original board game, highlighting the similarities and differences.  The reviewer notes that the PC version doesn't fully capture the essence of the board game experience, particularly in terms of the lack of real-time action.

**Criticisms:** The review criticizes the slow AI, the lack of modem support, and the sometimes tedious wait times during the computer opponent's turns.  The reviewer also points out that the game's unfinished state, with the promised modem support not yet implemented, is a significant flaw.

**Positive Aspects:** The review acknowledges the game's faithful translation of the board game's concept and design.  The instant replay feature and occasional commentary are also mentioned as positive additions.

**Conclusion:** The review concludes that while ""Blood Bowl"" is a faithful adaptation of the board game, the PC version falls short of expectations due to the slow AI, lack of modem support, and unfinished state.  The reviewer suggests that the game is enjoyable for strategy and sports gamers who are willing to overlook these shortcomings.

The review gives a detailed description of the game, highlighting its addictive nature and unique gameplay compared to other city-building simulations like SimCity.  The reviewer emphasizes that while similar in concept, SimTower focuses on the management of a single skyscraper, rather than an entire city.

**Game Overview:**

The review states that SimTower is the latest in Maxis' successful Sim series, but it's a more focused simulation.  Instead of managing an entire city, players build and manage a single skyscraper, including shops, offices, condos, and other amenities.  The goal is to earn high star ratings based on population count and tenant satisfaction.

**Key Features and Mechanics:**

* **Tenant Satisfaction:**  The review stresses the importance of tenant satisfaction, which is crucial for maintaining a successful tower.  The game allows for the placement of incompatible units (e.g., noisy fast-food restaurants near quiet condos) but suggests that rent adjustments can resolve these conflicts.
* **Elevator Management:**  A significant aspect of the game is managing elevator efficiency.  The review highlights a tool for checking elevator status and suggests that proper placement of elevators is essential for avoiding congestion and maintaining tenant satisfaction.
* **Metro Station:**  The game allows players to build metro stations, which open up underground complexes for dining and shopping.
* **Building Design:**  The game requires strategic placement of different building types to maximize tenant satisfaction and profitability.
* **Realistic Challenges:**  The review notes that the game presents challenges similar to SimCity, but on a smaller scale, focusing on traffic flow and mass transit within the skyscraper.

**Review Rating:**

The review doesn't explicitly state a numerical rating, but it uses positive language throughout, suggesting a favorable opinion of the game.  The presence of 5 stars in the screenshot indicates a positive user review.

**Additional Sections:**

* **Recommended Hardware:**  The page also lists recommended hardware specifications.
* **Screenshots:**  The page includes screenshots of the game's interface, showing the elevator management system, building layout, and other game elements.

It also explains how the ""Tool Bar"" allows pausing the game and performing specific actions like demolishing structures, laying lobby sections, creating office spaces, and more.  The reviewer also points out the functionality of getting information about specific areas, placing elevators and shafts, and creating single, double, and suite hotel rooms, restaurants, and shopping centers.  The review also explains how clicking on a tower area provides information about the space, and clicking on the people allows studying and renaming them.

**Review Content:** The reviewer discusses the game's strengths and weaknesses.  A positive aspect highlighted is the ability to get to know the inhabitants of the tower, which is compared to the old Commodore 64 game ""Little Computer People.""  The reviewer notes the high-resolution graphics that create a convincing illusion of a ""people farm"" of tiny skyscraper dwellers.  The reviewer also points out the ability to track individuals' movements throughout the day, and the ability to watch a person go through their daily routine.

**Criticisms:** The review identifies the lack of significant challenges as a major drawback.  The reviewer notes that after the initial construction phase, there isn't enough to do, and the game quickly becomes about watching the inhabitants rather than actively engaging in the game.

**Conclusion:** The review concludes that while the game is initially engaging, the lack of ongoing challenges leads to a repetitive experience.  The reviewer acknowledges the game's good graphics and interesting concept but ultimately finds the lack of challenge to be a significant flaw.

* **Rating:** 75%
* **Review Author:** T. Liam McDonald

**Review Summary:**

The reviewer, T. Liam McDonald, finds ""Power"" to be a solid strategy game, but not the most exciting or in-depth.  While praising the simple, chess-like gameplay and the potential for strategy, the reviewer notes that the graphics and sound are basic.  The real strength of the game, according to the review, lies in its ability to be played over modems, networks, or the internet.  The reviewer contrasts the game favorably with other board games, highlighting the lack of human interaction in the computer version.  The review also mentions that the game's AI is effective but ultimately lifeless.

**Technical Specifications and Requirements:**

Players control units (planes, infantry, tanks, ships) and maneuver them across the board to capture enemy flags.  The game's theme is simple: to crush the opponent by carefully maneuvering game pieces.  The reviewer notes that the game has a chess-like feel, with a degree of strategy involved in positioning units for attacks and counter-moves.  The game's AI is described as effective in directing opposing forces, but ultimately lifeless.

**Comparison to Board Game:**
