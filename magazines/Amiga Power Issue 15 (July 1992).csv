The page layout features a prominent game screenshot at the top, showing the game's menu system, with options for different teams and the ability to select a game mode.  The review is presented in a column format, with the review text interspersed with screenshots of gameplay.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by mentioning the current trend of FRP (Fantasy Role-Playing) games and how Ishar fits into that genre.  It notes that the game's interface is similar to Eye of the Beholder II, using a first-person perspective viewscreen.  Movement is controlled by clicking on arrows, and sub-screens display character stats, inventories, and actions.  A key difference from other RPGs is the emphasis on wilderness exploration and the retention of the first-person view in the outdoors.

**Character Generation and Party Dynamics:**

The review emphasizes the simplicity of character creation, starting with a fighter character and recruiting additional party members.  A total of 30 potential recruits are available, including various classes like rangers, paladins, monks, clerics, and wizards.  A significant aspect of the game is the party interaction.  Players can replace party members who die in battle, and existing members can interact with each other, potentially leading to arguments and even ""internecine bloodletting"" (internal conflict).  The review highlights the unique aspect of party members voting on new recruits, considering factors like race and alignment.  This can lead to unexpected and potentially problematic situations, as some characters might not be well-received by the existing party.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

The game world is described as realistically rendered, with detailed graphics for landscapes, buildings, and even trees and grass.  However, the review notes that the monsters in the game are somewhat simplistic in their behavior, exhibiting a repetitive ""stutter-swipe"" attack pattern.

**Additional Features:**

The review mentions the availability of a wide variety of weaponry and armor, as well as magic-using capabilities.  Players can explore villages to acquire supplies like food and weaponry.  The review also touches on the game's potential for player-character conflicts and the unique way party members interact with each other.

**Overall Impression:**

The review concludes by praising the game's originality in party member interactions and the realistic graphics.  It acknowledges the potential for conflicts and disagreements within the party, which adds a layer of complexity to the gameplay.  The review also notes that the game's monsters could be more engaging, but overall, the game is presented as a fun and interesting experience, particularly for fans of the D&D genre.
