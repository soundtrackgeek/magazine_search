"
55,"This page is a section from a magazine, likely an Amiga Power issue, dedicated to a game review or walkthrough, specifically for the game *Rainbow Islands*.  The page details various aspects of gameplay, including strategies, item usage, and enemy encounters.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

* **Gems:**  Enemies crushed by rainbows leave gems behind.  Gems are worth 700 points each, but their true value is higher due to their collection patterns.  Gems are only visible for a short time and can be difficult to collect.  The color of the gem is determined by the location of the enemy's death on the screen.  Collecting all seven colors grants an extra life.
* **Rainbow Usage:** Rainbows are a crucial element.  They can be walked on, jumped from, used to trap enemies, and used to crush enemies or objects below.  A maximum of 12 rainbows can be on screen at once.  Throwing a strip of two rainbows with three bands already on screen causes the oldest band to disappear, as does throwing a strip of three rainbows with two bands of three already on screen.  Jumping off a rainbow is worth 10 points.  Shooting rainbows and breaking them almost simultaneously while jumping into the rainbow is a useful technique for dealing with bosses.  Jumping on a rainbow causes it to crumble and fall, crushing or collecting anything below.
* **Hidden Bonus Objects:**  These objects are hidden in various locations, including on the tops of platforms, in bushes, or in mid-air.  Collecting a hidden bonus object triggers the next one in the sequence.  The sequence wraps around back to the Green Pepper once the Money Bag is collected.  A maximum of 10 bonus objects can exist on screen at once.
* **Bonus Objects:**  Various bonus objects are scattered around the islands, including fruit, vegetables, cakes, sweets, and treasures.  They disappear after 20 seconds.  There are also valuable bonus items like the Green Pepper (10 points) and the Money Bag (worth more).
* **Inhabitants:** The inhabitants of the Rainbow Islands start in a happy state but become angry after 12 seconds (or less on later islands).  They also get angry when trapped by a rainbow or when the ""Hurry!"" message appears.  Creatures that stray too far off the screen will disappear.  Killing a creature is worth 1,000 points, and killing multiple creatures simultaneously yields more points (up to 16,000).
* **Goal In:** Reaching the top of the first three rounds of an island triggers a magic chest that gives 16 bonus items (from a selection of 32), each worth 500 points.
* **Boss Room:** The fourth round of an island has a boss room.  The boss is a tough enemy that requires multiple hits to defeat.  The best strategy is to use rainbow traps to take advantage of the boss's brief periods of inactivity.

**Overall:** The article provides detailed instructions on how to play the game, including strategies for collecting gems, using rainbows, and defeating enemies.  It also highlights the importance of bonus objects and the boss battles.  There's no explicit review rating, but the information presented suggests a detailed walkthrough or guide rather than a simple review.

* **Rating:** 73% (out of 100)
* **Publisher:** Gremlin
* **Price:** £24.95
* **Programmer(s):** Magnetic Fields
* **Release Date:** Out now
* **Review Summary:** The review is largely negative, criticizing the two-player mode and the lack of significant improvements over the original *Supercars* game.  The reviewer notes that the new power-ups and two-player mode don't improve the game, in fact, they make it worse.  The game's difficulty curve is too steep, and the handling is poor, making it frustrating to play.  While the presentation is good, the core gameplay mechanics are not.  The reviewer highlights the repetitive nature of the gameplay and the lack of innovation.  The review concludes that the game is visually appealing but ultimately inferior to the original.

**Int'National Ice Hockey Review:**

* **Rating:** 48% (out of 100)
* **Publisher:** Impulze
* **Price:** £24.95
* **Programmer(s):** Gareth Briggs
* **Release Date:** Out now
* **Review Summary:** The review is extremely negative, describing the game as ""cheap and cheerful"" but ultimately a poor value.  The reviewer criticizes the pseudo-3D graphics, the poor AI, the confusing controls, and the frustrating gameplay.  The reviewer notes that the game is overly simplistic and lacks any significant depth or engaging gameplay elements.  The match is described as a series of stop-start moments, with the referee holding the puck for extended periods.  The review concludes that the game is not worth the price and is a poor alternative to other hockey games.

91,"This page from Amiga Power magazine, dated May 1991, features reviews and previews of several games.

**The Bard's Tale III Review:**

The review, which takes up a significant portion of the page, gives a mixed assessment of *The Bard's Tale III*.  The reviewer, Mark Ramshaw, criticizes the game's lack of innovation, stating that it visually and functionally resembles a C64 game, despite being released on a more advanced platform.  The reviewer also notes a disappointing lack of atmosphere and a feeling that the game's combat and character interaction could be improved.  While acknowledging the game's satisfying gameplay elements, the reviewer ultimately concludes that the game, while not a complete failure, could have been better, especially given the current abundance of similar role-playing games. The review gives the game a 67% rating.

**Super Monaco GP Review:**

This review details a conversion of the arcade racing game *Super Monaco GP* to the Amiga.  The reviewer, Stuart Campbell, praises the game's speed and accuracy, noting that it maintains the arcade game's fast pace even with the added scenery on the Amiga screen.  The mouse control is also highlighted as being adjustable and suitable for the player.  However, the reviewer points out a significant flaw: the game's conversion is not a true representation of the arcade game, as it lacks the original Monaco track and instead includes three new tracks.  The reviewer concludes that while the game is playable, it's not a perfect conversion and doesn't quite capture the essence of the arcade experience. The review gives the game a 72% rating.

**Warlock - The Avenger Review:**

This review covers *Warlock - The Avenger*, the third game in a series.  The reviewer notes the game's strong resemblance to the original *Druid* game, highlighting similar graphics and gameplay.  The reviewer points out that the game is essentially a continuation of the same formula, with increasingly difficult mazes and enemies.  The review doesn't find any significant innovations or improvements over the previous games in the series.  The review concludes that while the game is playable, it feels more like a continuation of the previous game rather than a truly original sequel. The review gives the game a 67% rating.

**Other Information:**

There are screenshots and images related to the games, including character portraits and game screens.  The page also includes a section on game reviews, with other game titles and ratings.
