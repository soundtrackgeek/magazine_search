68,"This page is from a magazine, likely *PC Gamer*, and is an article titled ""Making the Upgrade: How to Boost Your Game System.""  The article, written by Charles Brannon, is a guide for PC gamers on upgrading their systems to keep up with the demands of increasingly sophisticated video games.

The article begins by explaining that modern games require more processing power, memory, speed, and storage than older games.  It contrasts the requirements of older 386-based PCs with the more demanding needs of newer games, which require more powerful processors (like 486 or Pentium), faster video cards, at least 8 megabytes of RAM, and significant hard drive space.

The article emphasizes that keeping a computer up-to-date with the latest games is a challenge, but the cost of upgrades is often decreasing.  It advises readers to assess their current system before making any upgrade decisions.  The article suggests considering whether upgrading or selling the current system and buying a new one is more economical.  It also highlights that upgrading incrementally might be the best approach for those with limited budgets.

The article concludes by encouraging readers to consult a chart on the opposite page to understand the available upgrade paths, the benefits of each, and the cost-effectiveness of different options.  It promises a closer look at each upgrade option in subsequent sections.

The page also includes a small image of a beige-colored PC tower and a beige computer mouse.  The publication date and issue number are noted at the bottom left corner of the page."

**Video Card Upgrades:** The article discusses the importance of video cards for graphics performance, especially under Windows.  It recommends upgrading to a faster local bus accelerated video card, noting that these cards offload graphics processing from the CPU, potentially making a CPU upgrade unnecessary.  It mentions that some video cards support scaling, interpolation, and color conversion, which are important for fast game graphics.

**CD-ROM and Sound Card Upgrades:** The article highlights the importance of CD-ROM and sound card upgrades, often sold as upgrade kits.  It explains that these components are often upgraded separately, but a kit combining a 16-bit sound card (preferably with wavetable synthesis) and a quad-speed CD-ROM drive is a good option.

**Review Content:**

The review begins by praising the game's character/inventory screen, highlighting its efficient design and ease of use.  It then delves into the game's gameplay mechanics, focusing on the combat system.  The reviewer notes that the combat is reminiscent of dungeon crawls, with puzzles, and story elements.

The reviewer also discusses the game's cutscenes, noting their 3D rendering and cinematic feel.  The review touches on the game's use of role-playing elements, noting that the game's quests are often of the ""find-it-and-bring-it-back"" variety, and that the game's story is not as innovative as other role-playing games.

**Overall Impression:**

The review presents a balanced perspective, acknowledging the game's strengths while also pointing out its limitations in comparison to more modern and innovative games.  The 79% rating suggests a generally positive but not groundbreaking experience.

* **Price:** $59.95 (MSRP)

**Review Summary:**

The reviewer, Dan Bennett, gives the game a score of 82%.  The review highlights that while the game is a sequel to the popular ""X-COM,"" it doesn't offer significant improvements or innovations.  The core gameplay mechanics are largely the same, with new graphics and some minor changes in the names of weapons and creatures.  The reviewer notes that the game's primary action takes place underwater, which is a key difference from the original.

**Specific Points of the Review:**

* **Gameplay:** The reviewer states that the only real change in gameplay is the underwater setting, forcing players to use different weapons.  The game is more challenging than the original, but the process of equipping soldiers and ships is tedious.  Missions are split between land and sea, with no opportunity to re-arm between phases.
* **Graphics:**  While there are new graphics, they are not a significant improvement.
* **Innovation:** The reviewer finds little new or innovative in the game, and it feels like a rehash of the original ""X-COM.""
* **Comparison to Original:** The reviewer emphasizes that if the player has already played ""X-COM,"" there's little reason to buy ""Terror from the Deep,"" as the experience is largely the same.
* **Positive Aspects:** The reviewer acknowledges that the game is a good strategy game, but it lacks the innovative spirit of the original.
* **Negative Aspects:** The reviewer criticizes the tedious aspects of equipping soldiers and ships, and the lack of significant improvements over the original.

**Overall:**

The review concludes that ""Terror from the Deep"" is a decent strategy game, but it's essentially a re-skinned version of the original ""X-COM"" with a few minor changes.  The reviewer recommends the original ""X-COM"" over the sequel if the player has already played it.  The review is well-structured, providing a detailed overview of the game's features and comparing it to its predecessor.

The review describes ""The Daedalus Encounter"" as an interactive adventure game, where the player takes on the role of a character in the year 2135 during the final days of the First Interstellar War.  The game features a significant opening cinematic sequence, followed by gameplay that blends elements of puzzle-solving, adventure, and arcade-style action.

**Review Content:**

The review praises the game's improved gameplay over its predecessor, ""Critical Path,"" noting a significant increase in interactivity and puzzle elements.  The reviewer mentions the extended cinematic opening, the ability to adjust difficulty, and the substantial amount of time spent in the game (over 2 hours of live-action video).  A notable aspect is the use of QuickTime technology, allowing the player to navigate and examine objects in detail.  The reviewer also points out the game's use of a silent, interrogation-machine-like interface, comparing it to the HAL 9000 from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and the Voight-Kampff machine from ""Blade Runner.""

**Criticisms (Implicit):**

The review, written by Mark Pitcavage, gives the game a 75% rating.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by highlighting the game's core mechanic: racing against the clock while navigating a complex, maze-like environment controlled by a spinning clock hand.  The reviewer emphasizes the constant movement and the challenges presented by various hazards, including enemy clock hands, spikes, oil globs, and bombs.

**Review Highlights:**

* **Intricate Movement System:** The reviewer praises the innovative movement system as a key strength of the game, adding a new dimension to the standard puzzle genre.
