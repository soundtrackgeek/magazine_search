The reviewer notes that the difficulty isn't solely due to the number of enemies, but rather the ""damn unplayability"" of the controls and the slow movement of the player's ship.  The ship's small size and blocky design are also mentioned.  The graphics are praised for capturing the look of the arcade version, from the metallic backdrops to the murkiness of later levels.

**Specific Issues:** The reviewer points out two minor graphical discrepancies in the game.  One is a problem with an opening that doesn't function as intended, and the other is a series of guns that are arranged in a circle.  The reviewer also notes the game's ""nasty habit of loading in the first level at the start of each game,"" regardless of how far the player got in the previous game.  This is a common issue with multi-load games.  The review also mentions the game's ""particular bad loading system"" and that it's a problem for cassette-based users.

**Weaponry and Gameplay Mechanics:** The review describes the ship's indestructible shield and the powerful beam weapon.  The reviewer explains how the beam weapon's effectiveness depends on how long the fire button is held down.

**Overall Assessment:** The reviewer concludes that while the game is addictive, especially for disk users, the multi-load system is a significant drawback.  The review compares the game unfavorably to other similar games like IQ and Katakis, suggesting that those games offer a more satisfying experience.  The review concludes with a breakdown of the game's ratings for sound, graphics, lastability, and playability."
