53,"This page is a review of the video game ""Goblins 2,"" published in Amiga Power magazine in January 1993.  The review, written by Mark Winstanley, gives the game a mixed rating, describing it as a ""flawed diamond of a game.""

The review is presented in a two-column format.  The left column features screenshots and descriptions of gameplay elements, including the game's storyline, characters, and the initial stages of the game.  The right column contains the actual review text.

**Review Details:**

* **Rating:** The review is not explicitly given a numerical rating, but the overall tone suggests a mixed opinion.  The reviewer highlights both positive and negative aspects of the game.
* **Positive Aspects:** The review praises the game's cartoonish humor, slapstick elements, and the engaging soundtrack.  It also acknowledges the high standard of graphics and the comical timing of the story introduction.  The reviewer notes the game's enjoyable presentation and the lively performances of the supporting characters.
* **Negative Aspects:** The review criticizes the game's repetitive gameplay, where the player quickly learns the game's objectives.  The reviewer points out that the game's object-based interactions and the need for precise timing in certain situations can be frustrating.  The reviewer also notes that some gameplay elements, such as the need for simultaneous actions from the goblins, can be difficult and tiresome.  The review also mentions that the game's linear problem-solving and occasional glitches can detract from the overall enjoyment.
* **Specific Complaints:** The reviewer highlights the ""flawed"" aspects of the game, including the sometimes illogical or contrived situations, the lack of a joint inventory for the goblins, and the way that any highlighted object on the screen is somehow relevant, which is a common convention in games but can be tedious.
* **Overall Conclusion:** The review concludes that while the game has strong visual and audio elements, and is enjoyable to watch, the gameplay glitches and linear problem-solving can make it less enjoyable to play than to watch someone else play.  The reviewer ultimately suggests that the game is worthy of a TV slot, but the gameplay itself may not live up to the potential.

The page also includes a section titled ""Uppers"" and ""Downers,"" which further elaborates on the positive and negative aspects of the game's presentation and gameplay, respectively.  These sections provide more specific examples of the game's strengths and weaknesses.

The page layout includes pixelated graphics of the game's characters and environments, providing visual context for the review.  The page is part of a larger magazine article, as indicated by the ""GAME REVIEWS"" header and page number.

54,"This page is from a magazine, likely an Amiga computer gaming magazine, featuring a review of the game ""RoboSport.""

**Review Section (Page 54):**

The review, which takes up a significant portion of the page, discusses the game RoboSport, published by Ocean and developed by Maxis.  The review is critical of the game's title, noting that it doesn't follow the ""Sim"" naming convention of other Maxis games like SimCity and SimEarth. The reviewer expresses surprise that Maxis would deviate from this naming pattern.

The review also includes a quote from someone, likely a developer or a representative of Maxis, who states that the game attempts to inject humor to lighten the load of the game's complex strategy and simulation elements.

The review delves into the gameplay mechanics, describing how players control robots in a four-player survival mode.  It highlights the strategic aspects, such as covering fire, missile-carrying robots, and the difficulty of hitting crouching robots.  The reviewer also mentions the game's map, showing a top-down view of a city-like environment.

The review touches on the game's concept, explaining that players control robots with various objectives, including wiping out enemies, capturing flags, and rescuing hostages.  The reviewer notes that the game's parameters are customizable.

**Game Screenshots/Graphics:**

The page includes several pixelated screenshots or graphics of the game RoboSport.  These graphics show the top-down perspective of the game's environment, including buildings, terrain, and robots.  The graphics are typical of games from the early 1990s.

**Additional Information:**

The page also provides basic game information, such as the game's publisher (Ocean), authors (Maxis), price (Â£29.99), and release date.

**Overall:**

The page is a review of the game RoboSport, providing a critical yet informative overview of the game's features, gameplay, and overall impression.  The review is accompanied by screenshots and graphics of the game, giving readers a visual representation of the game's environment and gameplay.  The review's tone is somewhat critical, but also acknowledges the game's unique aspects.  The page is dated January 1993, indicating the time period of the review.
"
55,"This page is a game review for RoboSport, published in Amiga Power magazine in January 1993.  The review, written by Richard Longhurst, gives a detailed look at the game, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses.

**Review Rating:** The review doesn't explicitly state a numerical rating, but the overall tone suggests a mixed opinion.  The ""Bottom Line"" section summarizes the game as having ""plenty of mileage left in it"" but not being the ""best implementation of the idea.""  This implies a decent game, but not a groundbreaking one.

**Review Content:**

The review is divided into several sections:

* **""It's very much like Laser Squad"":** This section begins by comparing RoboSport to a similar game, Laser Squad.  The reviewer notes that the core gameplay mechanics are similar, but the graphics and control systems are different.  The reviewer emphasizes the voyeuristic aspect of watching the robots fight, and the use of a movie-like section to show the battle.  The reviewer also points out the game's focus on strategy and tactics, requiring players to predict enemy movements and set traps.

**Review Details:**

* **Game:** 3D Construction Kit II
* **Publisher:** Domark
* **Author:** Incentive
* **Price:** Â£49.99
* **Release:** Out now

**Review Content:**

The review begins by acknowledging that the program isn't a game in the traditional sense, but a tool for creating 3D environments.  The reviewer highlights the program's ability to create 3D worlds using cubes, pyramids, and other shapes, and to add animation and puzzles.  The reviewer also notes the inclusion of a sample editor for adding sound effects and a facility for autopilot movement within the created 3D environments.

The reviewer notes improvements over the previous version, including a revised manual with better organization and jokes.  However, the reviewer also points out persistent issues, such as slow graphics performance (two or three frames per second at best), which the reviewer attributes to the limitations of the Amiga hardware.

The review also mentions the inclusion of ready-made objects (like pianos and buses) and the ability to program more complex interactions within the 3D world.

**Rating:**

The review gives the program an 80% rating.  The reviewer explains the breakdown of this rating, starting with the base 80% given to the original program, adding 8% for the new features, subtracting 5% for the passage of time since the original review, and subtracting 3% for the lack of certain improvements.

**Reviewer's Conclusion:**

The reviewer concludes that the program is an improvement over the original 3D Construction Kit in many ways, but it's also a more expensive option.  The reviewer highlights the program's strengths (new features, improved manual) and weaknesses (slow graphics, high price).  The reviewer also notes that the program is a specialized tool for creating 3D environments, rather than a game.

**Additional Sections:**

There's a ""Bottom Line"" section summarizing the review's overall assessment.  The reviewer compares the new version to the original, noting improvements and drawbacks.  The reviewer also emphasizes the program's specialized nature as a tool for creating 3D environments, rather than a game.

* **Rating:** Three stars (âââ)

**That's Not On The Syllabus (Review):**

* **Rating:** One star (â)
* **Description:** This review is for a text-based adventure game set in a school.  The reviewer criticizes the premise, the dull location, and the unfriendly parser (the way you interact with the game).  The review notes that the game is humorous in style, but the story and interaction are frustrating.  The graphics are mentioned as being good.
