"
22,"This page is a game review for ""The Final Gate,"" a game for the Amiga CD32.  The review, written by Andy Smith, gives the game a 20% rating.

**Review Details:**

The review begins by stating that the game, despite its full motion video (FMV) elements, is not the breakthrough anticipated.  The reviewer criticizes the gameplay as simplistic and repetitive.  The core mechanic involves using a crosshair to shoot targets, but the targets are described as reminiscent of those found in older games like the Spectrum.  The reviewer notes that the game's energy meter, which depletes with each shot, forces players to conserve their shots, which is considered annoying.  The game also features a ""bearded chap"" who appears after successful shots, adding a brief, but ultimately unsatisfying, visual element.  The reviewer also points out that the game's difficulty increases significantly after losing lives, making the game frustrating.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

The review highlights two key gameplay elements:

* **Shooting Baddies:**  Players must shoot baddies that appear along the river.  Missing these targets results in a penalty, and failing to shoot them all leads to game over.
* **Music-Based Gameplay:** The game's music is a techno affair, and players are encouraged to shoot targets in time with the music.  The reviewer notes that this is a cool feature, but the overall gameplay is not engaging.

**Criticisms:**

The reviewer criticizes several aspects of the game:

* **Simple Gameplay:** The core gameplay is described as simplistic and not engaging.
* **Sound Effects:** The sound effects, aside from the music, are deemed rubbish.
* **Graphics:** The graphics are also criticized as poor.
* **Repetitive Gameplay:** The reviewer notes that the game's repetitive nature and difficulty make it frustrating.
* **Uninspired FMV:** The FMV sequences, while present, do not add significant value to the gameplay experience.

**Positive Aspects:**

Despite the numerous criticisms, the reviewer does acknowledge a positive aspect:

* **Music:** The music is praised as a high-beat techno affair that is enjoyable to play along with.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The review concludes that the game is ultimately not enjoyable, despite the music.  The reviewer recommends against purchasing the game, even if the player is familiar with the people in the game.  The final rating of 20% reflects the overall negative assessment of the game's gameplay, graphics, and sound effects.

**Additional Information:**

The page also includes a section with ""Uppers"" and ""Downers"" that summarize the positive and negative aspects of the game, respectively.  There is also a section describing the game's price and platform.  Finally, there are screenshots and images of the game's interface and gameplay.

23,"This page is a game review for ""Charlie J. Cool,"" published in *Amiga Power* magazine in May 1996.  The review, written by Martin Axford, gives the game a very negative assessment, rating it a dismal 15%.

The review begins with a brief introduction, highlighting the game's appearance as a somewhat unwelcome addition to the gaming landscape.  It then moves into a detailed description of the game's features, including:

* **Platforming Gameplay:** The core gameplay is described as a standard platformer, requiring the player to navigate levels, dodge obstacles, jump, kill enemies, and collect items.
* **Levels and Objectives:** The game features 28 levels, each with the goal of guiding the protagonist to the end without losing too many lives.  Success in each level is measured by a meter that indicates the character's ""goodness"" or ""badness"" based on the player's actions.
* **Collectables:** The game offers collectables like shields, shoes, and hearts, which provide benefits like invincibility, speed, and extra lives.  However, the review criticizes the inclusion of these items, suggesting they don't significantly enhance the gameplay experience.
* **Story and Humor:** The review notes a humorous, albeit somewhat bizarre, storyline involving the protagonist's journey through a purgatorial dentist's office and a journey to heaven or hell.  The reviewer finds the humor and the story itself to be uninspired and irrelevant.
* **Developer and Publisher:** The review mentions the game's developer (Nevada Software) and publisher (NRC Software), and the game's release history, including the company's previous liquidation.
* **Critic's Opinion:** The reviewer, Paul Mellerick, gave the game a 45% rating, which the author of the review in *Amiga Power* disagrees with, stating that the reviewer liked platformers and found the game to be below average.

The review concludes with a ""Bottom Line"" section, where the author states that the game is ""absolute rubbish,"" even at its budget price, and that it exemplifies the potential downfall of the Amiga platform.  The overall tone of the review is highly critical, expressing disappointment with the game's quality and lack of appeal.

24,"This page is from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, dated May 1996.  It's a feature article, as indicated by the ""FEATURE"" header.

The headline, ""THE TRUTH IS IN HERE,"" is large and prominent, set against a muted, bluish-gray background.  Two individuals, likely in FBI-style attire, are pictured in the center of the page.

30,"This page is a feature article from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, titled ""Fortune Telling.""  The article is a skeptical look at various methods of fortune-telling, including Tarot cards, palmistry, astrology, and runes.  The author, or a writer on behalf of the magazine, is clearly not a believer in the efficacy of these methods.

The article is structured as a series of sections, each dedicated to a different method.

**Tarot Cards:** The section begins by describing the structure of a standard Tarot deck, differentiating between the ""minor arcana"" and the ""major arcana"" cards.  It then outlines the process of using Tarot cards for fortune-telling, emphasizing the shuffling, cutting, and arranging of the cards into a meaningful pattern.  The author then presents Mr. Z's skeptical perspective, arguing that the symbolism of the cards is arbitrary and that the process is ultimately a manipulation of the subject's subconscious.

**Palmistry:** This section describes the process of palmistry, focusing on the analysis of hand lines and creases.  Again, the author presents Mr. Z's critique, arguing that the supposed correlations between hand features and future events are unfounded and illogical.

**Astrology:** The astrology section details the historical use of constellations to predict future events.  It explains the concept of the position of planets at the time of birth influencing personality and future events.  The author presents Mr. Z's skeptical view, questioning the logical basis for such claims.

**Runes:** This section discusses the use of runes, a method of divination using carved stones or other objects.  It describes the historical context of runes, particularly their use by the Vikings and other Scandinavian peoples.  The author again presents Mr. Z's skeptical perspective, questioning the validity of the method.

**Overall Tone and Rating:** The article's tone is clearly skeptical and critical of the various fortune-telling methods.  There's no explicit rating, but the overall message is that these methods are not reliable or based on sound logic.  The article is likely intended to entertain and inform readers about the history and practice of fortune-telling while simultaneously debunking the claims of their accuracy.
"
31,"This page is a feature article from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, titled ""Fortune Telling.""  It details various methods of fortune-telling, including the I Ching, tea leaves, a crystal ball, and the Ouija board.  Each section describes the method, how it works, and includes a humorous, cynical perspective from a character named ""Mr. Z.""

**I Ching:** The article explains the ancient Chinese Book of Changes, a method of divination using 50 sticks.  It describes the process of shaking the sticks and arranging them on trays to determine an interpretation.  Mr. Z's view is dismissive, suggesting the method is ""mystic bilge.""

**Tea Leaves:** This section describes the practice of interpreting patterns in tea leaves at the bottom of a cup.  The article notes that it's not a very reliable method.  Mr. Z's view is highly sarcastic and humorous.

**Crystal Ball:** The article describes the use of a crystal ball for divination, where a reader stares into the ball and interprets shapes and patterns to predict the future.  Mr. Z's view is that the practice is ""Bollocks.""

**Ouija Board:** This section describes the Ouija board, a method of communicating with spirits.  It details the process of using a planchette to spell out messages.  Mr. Z's view is that it's a method of frightening teenagers.

**Overall:** The article is presented in a lighthearted, humorous tone, despite the serious subject matter.

32,"This page is from a magazine, likely a children's or family-oriented publication, featuring an article about Ouija boards.  The article is titled ""Cut-Out-and-Keep Ouija Board"" and is part of a larger feature.

The article discusses the history of Ouija boards, particularly the Home Ouija Board, and the controversy surrounding its release.  It notes that a major toy manufacturer faced significant backlash and even possible vandalism from a group of eight or nine people who protested the board's release.  The article suggests that the protesters felt the board was ""meddling in forces it didn't understand.""

The article then delves into the history of Ouija boards, mentioning a 1958 comic, *Whizz-z-z Bangg-g-g!* that featured a DIY Ouija board design.  This board was shaped like the face of Tiger Bythetail, a popular character in the comic.  The article notes that the comic was discontinued shortly after due to complaints.

The article provides instructions on how to create a Ouija board (Ouijete) for family use.  It includes step-by-step instructions on cutting out and gluing cardboard pieces, creating a pointer, and gathering family members.  The instructions also include a section on how to use the Ouija board, including proper etiquette and questions to ask.

The article also includes a section on a game that can be played with the Ouija board, called ""Ouijette - The Game.""  This game involves rolling a die and moving a pointer on the board to form words, scoring points based on the length of the words.

Finally, the article includes a ""Professor Desmonde's Kwik Tip"" section, offering advice on avoiding confusion with similar-sounding items (like ""Weegee"" or ""Squeegee"").  It also includes a comic-strip-style exclamation, ""OOYAH.""

The article concludes with a brief mention of another Ouija-related project, ""OUIJA - BOARD OF FEAR,"" a board game with a supplementary video, and hints at its possible future release.

The overall tone of the article is somewhat playful and informative, while acknowledging the potential for controversy and misinterpretations surrounding Ouija boards.  There's a clear attempt to present the Ouija board as a fun and engaging activity for families, while also addressing concerns about its use.  There's no explicit endorsement or condemnation of the practice.

33,"This page is from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, dated May 1996.  It's a feature article titled ""Welcome to the World of the Strange,"" and it's part of a larger section or issue dedicated to the unusual and unexplained.

The article delves into the topics of telepathy, telekinesis, and general psychic phenomena.  It begins by introducing the concept of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) and its various manifestations, such as mind-reading, sending messages through thought, and predicting events.

The article then moves into a section titled ""Prescience,"" examining anecdotal evidence of people claiming to have foreseen tragic events, like a factory fire.  The author presents a specific example of a woman who dreamt of a fire and described it in detail to a friend, only to have the fire occur later with some matching details.  The article questions whether this is coincidence or something more, suggesting a paranormal explanation.

The article also touches on the sheer volume of daily thoughts and events occurring globally, highlighting the constant stream of experiences and occurrences.  It uses examples like car accidents, factory fires, and everyday activities to illustrate the vastness and diversity of human experience.

The page includes a visual element of tarot cards, likely to further emphasize the theme of the strange and unusual.  The overall tone of the article is skeptical but inquisitive, presenting evidence and claims while also questioning their validity.  The article's rating is not explicitly stated, but the tone suggests a critical, yet open-minded approach to the subject matter.

**Section 1: Uri Geller**

The section opens with a description of Uri Geller, a young Israeli who gained notoriety in the 1970s for feats like bending spoons and stopping watches.  The article highlights his encounter with James Randi, a well-known skeptic of paranormal phenomena.  It notes Randi's skepticism and his offer of a $10,000 reward to anyone who could prove paranormal powers.  The article then presents a counter-argument, mentioning Paul Daniels' claim that he and his son were denied admission to one of Geller's performances, without providing reasons.  The article implies that Geller's abilities might be explainable as stage magic.  A small image of Uri Geller is included.

**Section 2: Telepathy**

This section delves into the topic of telepathy.  It discusses the concept of sending thoughts to others without physical means, and the role of electromagnetic waves in this process.  The article acknowledges that while there are theories, there's no definitive scientific proof of telepathy.  It also mentions some anecdotal evidence of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) from the magazine's files, including a husband and wife who communicated through images.  The article concludes by stating that the lack of a clear explanation doesn't necessarily mean that the phenomenon is false, but that the evidence is not conclusive.

**Section 3: Other Strange Phenomena**

A brief mention is made of Marco Fezzietzi, a famous pianist, whose piano malfunctioned, forcing him to improvise.  This is presented as another example of a ""strange"" event.

**Overall:**

The article presents a balanced view of paranormal phenomena.  It acknowledges the existence of these events and the stories surrounding them, but also highlights the skepticism and lack of definitive proof.  The tone is somewhat inquisitive and open-minded, but ultimately leans towards a skeptical perspective.  The review rating is not explicitly stated, but the overall tone suggests a neutral or slightly skeptical approach to the subject matter.

The article details the experiment's setup, the results (a low score), and the conclusion that the experiment did not prove the non-existence of psychics.  The article suggests that the low score could be due to the subjects' lack of skill at the game rather than a lack of psychic ability.

The section includes a humorous and skeptical tone.

40,"This page is a review of the game ""Saturday Night Snooker"" for the Amiga computer, published in Amiga Power magazine in May 1996.

The review, written by Dave Golder, is presented within a larger article section dedicated to ""Game Reviews.""  The page's layout features a prominent title, ""SATURDAY NIGHT SNOOKER,"" and a subtitle, ""SHAREWARE.""

The review itself begins with a brief introductory paragraph that highlights the game's unusual focus within the current issue's ""PD"" (presumably a section dedicated to paranormal or unusual topics) section.

The review then delves into a detailed description of the game's features and gameplay.  The reviewer notes the game's claim to reflect a ""party atmosphere"" in its snooker gameplay, but criticizes the inclusion of sexually suggestive elements, particularly the presence of scantily-clad women.  The reviewer expresses concern about the game's portrayal of women and the sexual politics within the game's context.

The review also discusses the game's mechanics, including the control system (using a mouse or keyboard to aim and power shots), the ball physics (described as ""slightly dubious but at least consistent""), and the variety of gameplay options (normal snooker, color variations, two-player mode, and computer opponents).  The reviewer points out the game's lack of advanced shot options (no spin, stun, or swerve).

The review also mentions the game's graphical presentation, including the cartoonish depictions of the women and the animation of the balls.  The reviewer notes the game's presentation is ""excellent"" and the graphics are ""reasonable.""

The review concludes with a rating of four stars (★★★★) and a final comment, suggesting the game is ""innocent enough fun"" but might not appeal to everyone, particularly those with strong opinions on gender representation.

The page also includes screenshots and images of the game's interface, showing the control options, game setup, and the in-game graphics.  These visuals provide a glimpse into the game's design and features.  There's also a small image of a snooker hall, which is part of the game's setting.

41,"This page is a section from a magazine, likely a gaming magazine, featuring reviews and information about video games.  Specifically, it's a review of two games: ""Pic-It 2"" and ""Boris Ball.""

**Pic-It 2 Review:**

The review section for ""Pic-It 2"" details the gameplay, which involves a quiz-style format where players answer questions on various topics (sports, entertainment, geography, etc.).  The questions are presented in a grid-like format, and answering correctly causes parts of the grid to disappear.  The review notes that the game features celebrity pictures or Catchphrase-style puzzles as rewards for correct answers.  The reviewer highlights the game's decent visuals (digitized pictures of stars) and mild entertainment value, but criticizes the lack of variation in gameplay and the limited number of questions/catchphrases, which can become repetitive after a couple of hours of play.  The review also mentions that the game is shareware.

**Boris Ball Review:**

The review for ""Boris Ball"" describes it as a ""bounce-the-ball-off-the-bricks-to-destroy-them"" game, similar to the classic ""Breakout.""  The reviewer notes the game's impressive graphics (neon-like, almost radioactive), and the inclusion of various power-ups and power-downs, including multi-ball facilities, dynamite, extra lives, and speed-ups/slow-downs.  A unique aspect is the ""reset"" power-up, which returns the level to its initial state.  The reviewer praises the speed at which the game progresses due to the power-ups, but also points out that this can diminish the challenge.  The review also mentions the game's editor, which allows players to create their own levels.  The reviewer concludes that the game is a decent, mindless form of fun.

**Overall:**

The page presents two separate reviews, each with its own gameplay description and evaluation.  The reviews are written in a conversational style, using descriptive language to convey the experience of playing each game.  The reviews also include ratings, though the rating system is not explicitly stated.

**Review 1: Connect Four**

A review of the game ""Connect Four"" for the Amiga, rated as one of the worst PD games the reviewer has ever played.  The reviewer, clearly frustrated, describes the game as dreadful.  They played against the computer and found the AI to be completely random, failing to block obvious winning moves.  The review highlights the poor quality of the game, noting that it was one of three games on a disk that were all from 1994 or earlier, and thus not recent releases.

**Review 2: Pro Lottery**

A review of the game ""Pro Lottery."" The reviewer describes the game as a ""curio"" and notes that it claims to be able to predict lottery numbers, but ultimately admits that it's not much help.  The reviewer spends time discussing the game's claims about the law of averages and random number generation, concluding that the game's methods are ultimately not useful.  The review also mentions the game's charts and tables, and the overall impression is that the game is a fun, but ultimately useless, program.

**Review 3: Wargame Processor V1.7**

A review of the game ""Wargame Processor V1.7."" The reviewer describes the game as impressive, with high resolution graphics and a large number of menus.  However, the reviewer also notes that the game is extremely complex and confusing, with no clear instructions.

66,"This page is a document, likely a leaflet or a section from a larger publication, presenting a strongly biased and satirical argument against cows.  It's not a typical news report or review in the traditional sense.

The document is titled ""COWS – THE TRUTH,"" and the overall tone is accusatory and conspiratorial.  It presents a series of claims about cows, presented as factual, but with a clear agenda to demonize them.  The claims are not supported by evidence and are highly exaggerated.

The text is divided into numbered sections, each detailing a supposed negative aspect of cows.  For example:

* **Section i):**  Describes cows killing people through running them down and trampling them.  It includes a fictionalized account of a composer being killed by a cow.
* **Section ii):**  Claims cows are responsible for a rising crime rate, originating in rural areas and moving into towns.  It mentions 618 post office robberies committed by cows.
* **Section iii):**  States a creature previously identified as a puma was actually a cow.
* **Section iv):**  Links cows to terrorist activity, including the Iranian Embassy siege.
* **Section v):**  Claims cows were responsible for starting World War I.
* **Section vi):**  Connects cows to subversive elements like road protesters.
* **Section vii):**  States that MI5 has photos of cows being filthy.
* **Section viii):**  Claims a cow caused the loss of a Secretary of Commerce.
* **Section ix):**  Accuses unemployed cows of stealing jobs.

The document also includes a cartoonish image of a cow, and several handwritten-style comments and signatures at the bottom, which further contribute to the satirical and exaggerated nature of the piece.  These comments are from different individuals, and they are not part of the main text.

There is no review rating as this is not a review.  It's a satirical piece, not a genuine assessment of cows.  The document is clearly intended to be humorous and provocative, not to be taken seriously as a factual account.
