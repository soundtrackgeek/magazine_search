**Control and Flaws:** The reviewer immediately points out significant flaws in the game's control system.  The core issue is the unpredictable and often illogical way the game assigns control of players.  The algorithm for player control is described as problematic, frequently switching control to the wrong player, leading to frustrating situations where the player feels they are controlling one player, but the game has switched to another.  This is described as a ""preposterous situation"" and a ""ludicrously ridiculous flaw.""  Other issues include the difficulty of passing the ball, the way the game handles tackling, and the lack of a smooth, flowing passing game.

**Tackling and Passing:** The review criticizes the tackling mechanics, stating that players cannot steal the ball from opponents unless they slide tackle, which is often unpredictable.  The passing system is also criticized for being too slow and not allowing for smooth passing sequences.  The reviewer notes that the game's passing system is often disrupted by the game's algorithm, which can cause players to run away from the ball in unexpected ways.

**Other Flaws:** The review also points out issues with the game's player selection, the way the game handles the ball, and the way the game handles the opposition's movement.  The reviewer notes that the game's algorithm can cause players to run in unexpected directions, making it difficult to control the game's flow.

**Review Summary and Conclusion:** The review concludes with a summary of the game's strengths and weaknesses.  The reviewer states that the game has some redeeming features, but overall, the game's flaws outweigh its strengths.  The reviewer ultimately recommends against purchasing the game, stating that it will likely be a disappointment.

The review gives the game a rating of 60 out of 100.

**Review Details:**

The review begins by highlighting the game's unusual nature, noting that it's not a typical pool game.  It's described as ""bonkers"" in a way that's both enjoyable and frustrating.  The reviewer points out the game's ludicrously good computer players, who often use elaborate, unpredictable shots that don't always lead to the expected outcome.

The review is critical of the game's computer AI, but acknowledges the game's other strengths, such as its arcade-style gameplay and affordability.

The page also includes images, including a graphic of the game ""Disposable Hero"" and a picture of a CD32.  The overall tone is humorous and playful, appealing to the creativity and imagination of the readers. The review rating is not present, as this is not a review but a competition advertisement.

76,"This page is a review of the video game ""Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker,"" published by Corkers, for the Amiga 500, 600, and 1200.  The review, written by a reviewer identified as ""Colin,"" is accompanied by a second review from ""Jonathan Davies.""

**Colin's Review:**

The review begins with a general introduction about budget games, noting that this one is priced at Â£9.99.  Colin praises the cartoon animation and satisfying gameplay, but criticizes the game's control system as ""distinctly iffy"" in certain instances.  He describes issues with moving between the foreground and background, and the game's lack of restart points after losing a life.  He also mentions the game's ""sweet"" animation and the surprising cartoony style for a platform game.  The review gives the game a 70% rating.

**Jonathan Davies' Review:**

Jonathan Davies' review is more positive, praising the game's graphics and smooth animation.  He highlights the convincing physics of the game, the accuracy of ball control, and the ability to zoom and rotate the table.  However, he notes that despite the zoom and rotation options, lining up shots can be tricky.  He also points out that the game's graphics are impressive, and the animation is smooth.  The review gives the game a 90% rating.

**Overall:**

Both reviews highlight the game's strengths and weaknesses.  Colin's review focuses on the frustrating aspects of the control system and the lack of restart points, while Jonathan Davies' review emphasizes the game's strengths in animation, physics, and graphics.  The overall impression is that ""Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker"" is a decent game, but not without its flaws.  The differing ratings from the two reviewers reflect the subjective nature of game reviews.

**Wolfchild:**

* **Rating:** 52/100 (or 52%)
* **Review Summary:** The reviewer, Steve McGill, criticizes Wolfchild's gameplay as ""no fun at all"" despite its sprite-based visuals.  They find the lack of engaging car-racing elements in a supposed racing game to be a significant flaw.  The reviewer notes the game's animation is ""slidy"" and ""two-dimensional,"" falling short of other RPGs in this regard.  The review also mentions the game's fast-paced action sequences, but ultimately concludes that the game lacks the ""something"" to make it truly engaging.

**Torvak the Warrior:**

* **Rating:** 11/100 (or 11%)
* **Review Summary:** Stuart Campbell's review is highly negative, describing the game as ""comparatively measly"" and ""very poor"" even for its low price.  The reviewer criticizes the slow gameplay, poor enemy response, and the overall lack of engaging mechanics.  The game's design is compared unfavorably to the 1980s arcade game *Rastan*, highlighting the disappointing nature of the conversion.  The review concludes that the game is not worth the price or time investment.

**MiG-29M Super Fulcrum:**

* **Rating:** 60/100 (or 60%)
* **Review Summary:** Jonathan Davies' review is more mixed. While acknowledging the game's decent flight simulation elements and realistic plane handling, the reviewer finds the game ""a bit boring"" and lacking in excitement.  The graphics are described as ""squiggly-lines-and-dots,"" and the missions are not numerous enough to keep the game engaging.  The review concludes that while the game is solid, it doesn't offer anything unique or particularly enjoyable compared to other flight simulators.
