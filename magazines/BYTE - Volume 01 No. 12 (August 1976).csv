46,"This page is an article, likely from a vintage computer magazine (like BYTE), titled ""True Confessions: How I Relate to KIM.""  It's a technical article about troubleshooting and improving a KIM-1 microcomputer system.

The article begins with a personal anecdote from the author, Yogesh M. Gupta, who recently purchased a KIM-1 computer card and is encountering some problems.  He states that while the KIM-1 is a good value, some issues exist, and the article aims to address these.

The core of the article focuses on improving the performance of the KIM-1's memory system.  It specifically addresses the issue of using slow random access memory (RAM) chips (like the 2102) with the KIM-1's 6502 processor.  The author explains that the slow RAM chips require a specific data hold time, which the 6502 processor, running at a higher speed, can't always meet.

The article then presents a circuit diagram (Figure 1). This circuit is designed to create an alternative, slower clock cycle for the 6502 processor.  The diagram shows various integrated circuits (ICs), including 7404, 7474, and 7400 logic chips, along with resistors, capacitors, and a 2.0 MHz crystal.  The circuit uses a ""SPEED SELECT"" line to switch between fast and slow clock cycles, allowing the processor to work with the slower RAM chips without data loss.

The article explains how the circuit works to synchronize the processor's speed with the memory's limitations, allowing the use of a mix of fast and slow RAM chips in the same system.  The author emphasizes that this solution allows the use of cheaper, slower RAM chips while maintaining the processor's functionality.

The article is well-organized, with clear explanations and a detailed circuit diagram.  The author's goal is to provide a practical solution to a common problem faced by KIM-1 users.  The overall tone is technical and problem-solving oriented.  There's no explicit review rating, but the author's tone suggests a positive assessment of the KIM-1's value despite the need for modifications.

75,"This page contains technical documentation, likely from a vintage computer or electronics manual, describing software routines for driving a television display.  It details how to clear the screen, insert spaces, and display characters on the TV.

**Section 1: Utility Software for Driving the TV Readout (Listing 1):**

This section provides assembly language code (in hexadecimal) for three subroutines: CLEARTV, SPACE, and TVOUT.  These subroutines are responsible for clearing the screen, displaying a space character, and displaying any other character, respectively.  The code is meticulously laid out, showing the hexadecimal opcode, label, operation, operand, and a commentary explaining the function of each instruction.  The commentary clarifies the purpose of each step, such as setting up home reset characters, looping for space insertion, and loading characters into the accumulator for display.  The code assumes a latched output port and uses registers A, B, and C.

**Section 2: 8080/Z80 Driving Software:**

This section describes how a microprocessor (likely an 8080 or Z80) can drive the television display.  It explains that the display is controlled by a 8-bit output port, specifically port 0.  The code for the display routines (CLEARTV, SPACE, and TVOUT) are designed to be used with this port.  The main subroutine, TVOUT, is located at memory address <0> 372.  The programmer loads the A register with a character code from a table (Table 1), and then calls the TVOUT subroutine to display the character.  The table includes standard ASCII characters, upper and lower case, and some graphics characters.  The high-order bit of the 8-bit character code is set to 1.  For characters with graphics, subtracting 2 from the leftmost digit of the ASCII code provides the equivalent 7-bit ASCII code.

**Section 3: Conclusion:**

The conclusion summarizes the design of the television display system.  It highlights the versatility and self-contained nature of the circuit, suitable for small, inexpensive computer systems.  The system can be built from scratch or from a kit.  The extended character set (including upper and lower case, special characters, and Greek) makes the display useful for a variety of applications.

86,"This page is a technical document, likely from a textbook or technical journal, describing a type of logic gate called ""12L"" (or ""I²L,"" as the title indicates).

The document begins with a title: ""What's an I²L (I squared L)?"".

Following the title, there's an introductory paragraph that explains that transistor-transistor logic (TTL) is popular due to its speed, affordability, and availability. However, it consumes significant power compared to metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) logic. The author then introduces 12L logic as a potential solution to combine the best aspects of both.

The text then dives into the specifics of 12L logic.  It includes:

* **Figure 1:**  Two diagrams labeled (a) and (b).  Diagram (a) shows a conceptual schematic of a typical TTL logic gate, illustrating the use of resistors. Diagram (b) shows the equivalent logic function as an 12L gate, highlighting the use of transistors instead of resistors.  The diagrams are crucial for understanding the fundamental difference in circuit design between TTL and 12L.  The text accompanying the figures explains the differences in component usage and how this leads to lower power consumption in the 12L design.

* **Explanation of 12L:** The text explains that 12L logic gates use transistors instead of resistors, eliminating the resistive losses that contribute to power consumption in traditional TTL designs. This results in lower power dissipation.

* **Comparison to Conventional TTL Gates:** A section titled ""Conventional TTL Gates"" discusses the power consumption in conventional TTL gates, highlighting the role of resistors. It then contrasts this with the 12L design, emphasizing the elimination of resistors and the resulting power savings.  It also shows a schematic of a conventional TTL gate and a 12L gate, side-by-side, to illustrate the differences.

* **Discussion of Cost and Speed:** The text briefly touches on the cost and speed aspects of 12L logic.  It mentions that cost is a factor to consider and that Figure 2a (which is not shown on this page) illustrates a possible configuration.  It also notes a special pin (Vjj) related to speed, which will be discussed further in a later section (not present on this page).

The page is clearly part of a larger document, as it refers to ""Figure 2a"" and mentions that the discussion of speed will be continued elsewhere.

This leads to lower manufacturing costs.

* **Power and Speed:** The text discusses the relationship between power consumption and speed in 12L circuits.  It notes that 12L gates can achieve higher speeds than CMOS or TTL at the same frequency, but at the cost of higher power consumption.  The author suggests that by controlling the power supplied to the gate (via a resistor), the speed can be adjusted.  The pin marked Vjj is introduced as a new power pin to control this speed.

* **Compatibility with TTL:**  A significant portion of the text focuses on the compatibility of 12L with TTL logic levels.  It explains that 12L will be manufactured to be compatible with TTL, but a small voltage difference (0.6 Vdc) exists between the logic levels.  This means that interface logic will be needed to convert between the two systems.  The author also notes that this interface logic will likely be removed in the future, allowing for pure 12L systems.

* **Operating Frequency:** The page mentions that 12L is designed to fill a gap in the market for logic circuits operating in the 2 to 20 MHz range, a frequency range where TTL and CMOS might not be optimal.

* **Higher Voltage Compatibility:** The text also discusses the possibility of higher voltage 12L circuits compatible with CMOS, but notes that this will likely slow down the gate speed due to the thicker layers required for higher voltage operation.

* **Practical Implications:** The final section, titled ""REAL Practical Terms,"" attempts to translate the technical details into more user-friendly language, explaining the practical implications of the 12L design for engineers and designers.

Overall, the page presents a technical comparison and analysis of the 12L logic gate, highlighting its advantages in terms of cost and manufacturing efficiency, while also acknowledging its limitations and the need for interface logic to ensure compatibility with existing TTL systems.
