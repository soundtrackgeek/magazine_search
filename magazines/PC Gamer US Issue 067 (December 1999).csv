127,"This page is a review of the video game ""Homeworld,"" likely from a publication like PC Gamer.

The top portion of the page features a large, detailed image of space combat, showcasing the game's graphics and the action.  Below the image, a headline states ""Homeworld's prime ingredients"" and lists the game's key strengths: graphics engine, control mechanics, scripting, mission structure, and narrative flow.  The text emphasizes how these elements work together to create a compelling and immersive experience.

A section titled ""ION CANNON FRIGATE"" provides a visual example of the game's action, with ships firing on enemy capital ships.  The text accompanying this image describes the game's 3D space, control mechanics, and how units can be grouped into fleets for easier movement and attack formations.  It highlights the ability to view the action from any angle and the detailed 3D screen, which can be zoomed, rotated, or moved.  A larger-scale map is also mentioned as a useful tool.

The review further details the game's narrative and mission structure.  It explains how the narrative is integrated into the gameplay, with missions tied to the journey of the mothership, which acts as a carrier, repair craft, and unit builder.  The review notes that missions can change during the course of a mission, and that players might be unexpectedly returned to previous locations with increased difficulty.  A specific example is given of Chapter 6, where players must defend against waves of attackers while the hyperdrive charges.

The review also mentions the game's unique flow, where missions are broken into locations, chapters, and short-term goals.  The reviewer notes that ships built early in the game can remain useful throughout the game if treated with care.

The page also includes a small graphic with ship types and their descriptions.

128,"This page is from a PC Gamer magazine article, likely from December 1999, titled ""Using Formations.""  It's a guide on how to effectively use different ship formations in the game Homeworld.

The article discusses several ship formations, each with its strengths and weaknesses, particularly in online multiplayer.  It's not a simple review of the game itself, but rather a tactical guide.

**Specific Formations and Descriptions:**

* **Broad:**  This formation is described as ""parade formation,"" good for organizing ships before a battle, but not effective in combat.

* **Claw:**  This formation is best for large fleets centered around capital ships.  It allows for sustained fire on a target, with interceptors and corvettes acting as ""talons"" to support the main force.

* **Protecting the Collector:**  This formation focuses on protecting resource collectors.  It emphasizes keeping collectors close together with resource controllers and a sufficient number of interceptors, corvettes, and frigates.

* **Sphere:**  This formation is a purely defensive tactic, where ships form a sphere around a target, allowing fire from all directions.  The article credits a designer, Alex Garden, for this tactic.

* **X:**  This formation is a good all-around formation for supporting and attacking multiple smaller targets.  It's less effective against larger targets due to the wider spread of fire.

* **Delta:**  This formation leverages Homeworld's ability to bind units to multiple groups.  It allows for flexible attack strategies, including splitting forces into wedge-shaped assault groups for faster attacks and retreats.

* **Protecting the Mothership:**  This formation focuses on defending the mothership from all angles.  It involves positioning ships in a box-like formation around the mothership, with heavy cruisers on the inside line and assault frigates on the outside.

* **Wall:**  This formation is best for positioning mothership defenders, creating a wall of frigates to protect the inner and outer parts of the fleet.

**Overall:**

The article provides detailed explanations of each formation, including the optimal ship types and numbers to use, and the situations in which each formation is most effective.  It's clearly aimed at players looking to improve their tactical skills in Homeworld, particularly in online play.  There's no explicit rating, but the tone suggests the article is intended to be helpful and informative.

179,"This page is a PC Gamer review of the video game ""Silver,"" published in December 1999.

**Review Rating:** 81%

**Game Overview:**

The review details a role-playing game (RPG) titled ""Silver,"" developed by Infogrames and published by Infogrames North America.  The game is described as having a ""Japanese-y look and feel"" with 3D characters and large swords against 2D backgrounds.  The plot centers around a young hero, David, who embarks on a journey against forces of evil after his wife is kidnapped.  The game features a variety of locations, from observatories to enemy lairs, and encounters with monsters and other adventurers.  The gameplay style is described as a real-time combat system, viewed from a third-person perspective.  The reviewer highlights the game's inventive combat system, but also notes some imperfections.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

The review emphasizes the real-time combat, where players control David and other party members.  The reviewer points out that the AI for controlling characters other than the primary character is not always effective, leading to situations where other party members stand around doing nothing during combat.  The camera angles change depending on the environment, and players initiate attacks by holding down the Control key and left mouse button while moving the mouse.  Defensive mode is activated by pressing the right mouse button.  The game features a map system that allows players to quickly travel and save at any point.  The magic system involves collecting orbs that grant special abilities like fire or ice blasts.  The game also includes various types of food and potions to restore health.

**Graphics and Sound:**

The review praises the game's beautiful backgrounds with special effects like rain and electric bursts.  The graphics are described as ""pretty"" and ""fun,"" but the reviewer doesn't elaborate on the sound design.

**Review Conclusion:**

The reviewer concludes that ""Silver"" is a fun game with an interesting plot, but the difficulty in controlling multiple characters can be frustrating.  The reviewer likens the experience to a date with Sandra Bernhardt – enjoyable but not a long-term commitment.  The review highlights the game's strengths, such as the pretty graphics, fun real-time combat, and entertaining story, but also points out the weaknesses, such as the frustrating character control and the linear storyline.  The review also mentions that the European version of the game had a different save-point system, which was improved in the US release.

**Technical Specifications:**

The page includes the technical requirements for running the game, including the required processor (Pentium 166), RAM (32MB), hard drive space (160MB), video card (DirectX-compatible with 2MB RAM), and CD-ROM drive (12x).

**Additional Notes:**

The review includes a quote from Michael Wolf, who provides a summary of the game's plot and gameplay.  The page also includes a ""Final Verdict"" section with a numerical rating and a breakdown of the game's strengths and weaknesses.

The plot is described as confusing and erratic, with a protagonist tasked with retrieving a giant bird egg.  The reviewer highlights the confusing and often illogical nature of the game's plot, including the journey, the characters' dialogue, and the overall path.

* **Gameplay Mechanics:** The reviewer notes that the game's puzzle elements are similar to other click-and-survey games, but the game includes one item that makes no logical sense.  The game's animations are described as fun, but some areas are too dark.  The sound effects and score are inconsistent.
* **Interface and Navigation:** The game's interface is described as a Myst-style click-and-explore, but the reviewer notes that the game doesn't allow for viewing all 360 degrees of the world.  The game's cutscenes are described as blending nicely with the game.

The computer is a Celeron 300A overclocked to 450MHz with an A-bit BH6 motherboard, Canopus TNT video card, and Diamond Vortex 90 soundcard.  The issue is recurring error messages.
