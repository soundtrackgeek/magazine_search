The reviewer highlights the two-player mode, but also notes that if one player dies, the game restarts, which can be frustrating.  The bottom line is positive, calling it a wafer-thin but enjoyable little James Bond romp that's actually better than most proper James Bond games.

The reviewer highlights the monsters, the reward system for hitting them, and the overall fun of the two-player mode.

**1. Puffy's Saga:**

* **Game:**  The Hit Squad
* **Price:** ¬£7.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review:**  The review describes the game as a ""Gauntlet-type, overhead scrolling mazey affair"" where the player, Puffy (a yellow ball), navigates a castle to collect dots.  The reviewer notes the game's slowness and jerkiness, but also the presence of various enemies (ghosts, acid puddles, etc.) and the need to eat lamb to increase Puffy's energy.  The reviewer finds the game tedious and a poor use of the game license, despite the graphics.

* **Game:** Pro Tennis Tour
* **Price:** ¬£7.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review:**  The review describes the game as a tennis simulation.  The reviewer praises the game's presentation, but criticizes the controls as ""agonisingly difficult to grasp.""  The reviewer notes that the game is similar to real-life tennis, but the controls are difficult to master.
