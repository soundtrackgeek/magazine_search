The bottom line gives it an 81% rating and describes it as simplistic but addictive, with some neat touches.

The bottom line gives it a high rating (91%) and calls it an absolutely genuine, bona fide, real McCoy-type classic game at a bargain price.

* **Pang:**  This game receives a 57% rating.  The reviewer describes it as a re-entry into the All-Time Top 100, a favorite arcade game, and a good example of a coin-op converter.  The reviewer highlights the two-player mode, but also notes that if one player dies, the game restarts, which can be frustrating.  The bottom line is positive, calling it a wafer-thin but enjoyable little James Bond romp that's actually better than most proper James Bond games.

* **Nightbreed:**  This game receives a 91% rating.  The reviewer finds it a weird game where you're attacked by the creatures you're trying to save.  The reviewer highlights the monsters, the reward system for hitting them, and the overall fun of the two-player mode.

**1. Puffy's Saga:**

* **Game:**  The Hit Squad
* **Price:** £7.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review:**  The review describes the game as a ""Gauntlet-type, overhead scrolling mazey affair"" where the player, Puffy (a yellow ball), navigates a castle to collect dots.  The reviewer notes the game's slowness and jerkiness, but also the presence of various enemies (ghosts, acid puddles, etc.) and the need to eat lamb to increase Puffy's energy.  The reviewer finds the game tedious and a poor use of the game license, despite the graphics.
* **Bottom Line:**  Nice graphics, but otherwise a stupendously tedious waste of a license.  Even a younger player would likely rush out and overturn a police car.


**2. Pro Tennis Tour:**

* **Game:** Pro Tennis Tour
* **Price:** £7.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review:**  The review describes the game as a tennis simulation.  The reviewer praises the game's presentation, but criticizes the controls as ""agonisingly difficult to grasp.""  The reviewer notes that the game is similar to real-life tennis, but the controls are difficult to master.

**3. Castle Master:**

* **Game:** Castle Master
* **Price:** £7.99

* **Game:** Touchdown
* **Price:** £9.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review:** The review describes the game as a football game with a vintage feel.  The reviewer notes that the game is similar to the Spectrum game ""Match Day,"" but with slightly different gameplay.  The reviewer also mentions the game's management section as being forgettable.
