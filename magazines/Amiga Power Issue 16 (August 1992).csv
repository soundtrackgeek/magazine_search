The game aims to provide a realistic experience of controlling a highly advanced aircraft at low altitude, emphasizing 3D simulation technology.  A key feature is a training program within the game, allowing players to practice basic flight skills before engaging in combat missions.

* **Rating:** 83%
* **Publisher:** Touchdown!
* **Price:** £9.99
* **Review Summary:**  The review describes the game as ""a very unusual game"" with 3D graphics in a first-person view.  While the control system is praised as decent, the plot is deemed bog-standard, and the game's unique selling point is the world's shape, a tesseract or hypercube.

**Sim City Accessories:**

* **Architecture 2 and Terrain Editor:**  These are reviewed together.
* **Publisher:** Action 16
* **Price:** £9.99 each
* **Review Summary:** The review by Jonathan Davies criticizes the games' value for money.  While the reviewer acknowledges the potential for interesting city design, the games are ultimately deemed pointless and a way to milk the Sim City franchise.  The reviewer notes that the games only change the graphics of the base Sim City game, requiring extra installation steps and blank disks.  The reviewer also notes that the games are essentially the same as the original Sim City, with only minor graphical modifications.

The reviewer concludes that, while the concept is interesting, the execution lacks depth.  The reviewer also notes that the game is not a budget-friendly alternative to more cinematic adventure games.
