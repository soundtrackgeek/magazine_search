**Game Overview:**

The review describes ""A Wicked"" as an ""electric dreams"" game, priced at £24.99.  The game is presented as a diabolically addictive experience, drawing inspiration from South American Sun God charms and legends of good versus evil.  The player is thrust into a conflict between Good and Evil, entering the Palace of the Shining Thrones to face the Lord of Light.  The player is transformed into a flaming star to fight Evil.

The game mechanics involve battling Evil guardians (like a triple-headed dragon) and their growth.  The player must surround Evil portals with Good growth to eliminate them.  Good growth can only surround Evil portals if all the surrounding Evil growth is destroyed.  The game features astrological signs (Scorpio, Libra, Virgo) that the player can travel to for battles.  The further the player progresses through the signs, the more challenging the Evil becomes.  The game also features portals and spores that can be used to create more growth.
