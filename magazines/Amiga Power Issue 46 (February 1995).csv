90,"This page is an advertisement/article from a magazine, likely *Animal Power*, from February 1995.  It's a passionate plea against video games that are perceived as exploiting and harming woodland creatures.

The headline, ""JOIN THE AP HUNT SABS,"" is large and bold, drawing the reader's attention.  The overall tone is urgent and accusatory.

The text is divided into sections.  The first section, ""A CALL TO ACTION BY AMIGA POWER,"" directly addresses the reader, using a confrontational tone.  It accuses software companies of exploiting and harming woodland creatures in their games.  The section outlines a five-point action plan to combat this perceived cruelty.

The five-point plan is detailed:

1. **Douse Cardgians:**  This involves dousing people associated with the game companies with camphor or peppermint and dragging them across popular routes to game shops. The goal is to deter customers from buying the games.

2. **Picket Shops:**  This involves picketing game shops and protesting by marching and chanting a tuneless song.

3. **Harass Customers:**  This involves harassing customers who buy the games, following them out of the shops, spraying them with paint, and filming them.  The goal is to shame them and make them aware of the issue.

4. **Write to MPs:**  This involves writing to Members of Parliament to demand an inquiry into the games.

5. **Boycott Software:**  This involves boycotting the products of the companies that produce the games.

The article also includes images of game screens, likely from the games being targeted.  These images are used to illustrate the point of the article and to show the reader what the games look like.  There are also images of animals, likely to evoke sympathy and support for the cause.

The overall rating, if one could be assigned, would be strongly negative towards the video game companies and their products.  The article is clearly advocating for a boycott and other forms of protest.
