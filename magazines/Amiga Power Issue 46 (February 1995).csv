The text is divided into sections.  The first section, ""A CALL TO ACTION BY AMIGA POWER,"" directly addresses the reader, using a confrontational tone.  It accuses software companies of exploiting and harming woodland creatures in their games.  The section outlines a five-point action plan to combat this perceived cruelty.

The five-point plan is detailed:

5. **Boycott Software:**  This involves boycotting the products of the companies that produce the games.
