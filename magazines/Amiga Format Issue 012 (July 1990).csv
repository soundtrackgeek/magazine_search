31,"This page is a promotional piece, likely from a magazine or catalog, for a series called ""Real Things"" and a specific book or product within that series titled ""Brian Larkman flies with the Birds.""  It's a detailed description of the book's content and approach to understanding and depicting natural movement, specifically focusing on birds.

The text is organized into several sections:

* **Introduction:** The opening paragraphs introduce the concept of capturing the essence of nature's movement, highlighting the difficulty and complexity of natural processes.  It emphasizes the importance of observation and the role of drawing in understanding these dynamics.  The author, Brian Larkman, is introduced as the subject matter expert.

* **Method and Approach:** The text explains that the book's approach combines observation with spontaneous expression.  It suggests that the act of drawing the movements of birds and waves mirrors the actions themselves, creating a deeper understanding of the forces at play.  The author emphasizes the importance of trial and error in the drawing process.

* **Limitations of Other Media:** The piece then contrasts the book's approach with other methods of capturing movement, such as film, video, and traditional animation.  It points out the limitations of these media in conveying the fluidity and dynamism of nature, highlighting how they often freeze or simplify the motion.

* **The Power of Computer Animation (Implied):** The final section subtly suggests that the book's approach, combined with the potential of computer animation, offers a new way to capture and convey the essence of natural movement.

**Overall Impression:** The page is designed to be engaging and informative, using imagery (a bird in flight, a stylized landscape) to complement the text.  The tone is instructional and encouraging, aiming to inspire readers to explore the natural world through drawing and artistic expression.  The page is not a review in the traditional sense, but rather a promotional piece that highlights the book's unique approach.  There's no explicit rating given.
"
32,"This page is from a magazine, likely Amiga Format, judging by the text and layout.  It's a section dedicated to the work of an artist and the techniques used in creating illustrations, specifically for computer graphics.

The page contains several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the artist's work and the challenges of translating traditional techniques to digital media.

**Section 1:  Santorini Storks**

This section discusses a specific illustration of Santorini Storks.  It highlights the difficulty in conveying the dynamism of a moving animal in a static image.  The text mentions a high-resolution version of the image, and a tutorial on digitization from a previous issue (Issue 11).  It also notes that the conversion from 32 colors to a lower resolution has slightly reduced the quality of the foreground buildings, but the overall quality of the image is still considered good.

**Section 2: Kestrel**

This section focuses on another illustration, a Kestrel.  The text points out that this image has suffered more from the color reduction than the Santorini Storks illustration.  While still vibrant and realistic, the single shade of red used doesn't capture the full range of colors in the original image (seven shades).

**Section 3: The Artist and His Work**

This section is a more general overview of the artist's style and techniques.  It describes the artist's typical work as being in watercolour, emphasizing the ""jizz"" or character of the subject.  The artist's style is described as ""calligraphic"" and reminiscent of Japanese brushstrokes.  The text then discusses the artist's transition to computer illustration, noting that while the computer method isn't as spontaneous as watercolour, the broken edges and imperfections of the computer-generated image can create a similar natural effect.

**Section 4: Animations and Animbrushes**

This section discusses the artist's work in animations and animbrushes, specifically for a project called ""Real Things - Birds.""  The text emphasizes that the animations still convey the spirit and atmosphere of the birds in their natural settings, rather than focusing on precise scientific accuracy.

**Overall:**

The page is a review or feature article, showcasing the artist's work and discussing the challenges and benefits of translating traditional artistic techniques to computer graphics.  The text is descriptive and technical, providing insights into the artistic process and the limitations of the technology at the time.  There's no explicit review rating, but the tone suggests a positive assessment of the artist's work and the software used.

The reviewer concludes that while the game might be suitable for basic math practice, it's not a particularly engaging or effective learning tool. The game is priced at £22.95.

**The Talking Storybook ""Little Red Hen"" Review:**

The review of ""The Talking Storybook 'Little Red Hen'"" is more positive in its assessment of the graphics and sound quality.  The reviewer praises the use of Amiga's sound and graphics capabilities, describing the pictures as ""pretty"" and the music as ""enchanting.""  The reviewer also acknowledges the story's familiarity as a children's favorite.  However, the reviewer criticizes the synthesized speech, calling the robot voices ""unatmospheric.""  The reviewer also notes the option to turn off the speech and music, and a word-finding game.  The reviewer highlights the potential for the game to be used as a supplementary tool for reading, but ultimately concludes that the lack of a genuine connection between the child and the story, and the difficulty in recognizing the words spoken, make it less effective than a traditional picture book. The game is priced at £19.95.

The page also includes screenshots of the game interfaces, showing menus, game screens, and character graphics.  There are also sections describing the game's gameplay mechanics, such as the magician character in ""Math-a-Magician"" and the storybook format in ""The Talking Storybook.""  The page is part of a larger publication, likely an Amiga computer magazine, as indicated by the ""134 AMIGA FORMAT"" at the bottom.

136,"This page is a section from a magazine, likely *Amiga Format*, featuring reviews and information about software for the Amiga computer system.  The page focuses on two software packages: ""World Atlas Centaur Software"" and ""MyPaint Prism Computer Products.""

**World Atlas Centaur Software (£34.95):**

This review describes a world atlas program designed for older children.  It's presented as a floppy disk program, aiming to be an ambitious educational tool.  The reviewer highlights its comprehensive approach, providing facts, figures, and historical background on 170 nations.  However, a significant criticism is the program's ""Stateside bias,"" favoring US information over other countries.  The reviewer also notes the program's detailed facts and figures for each country, accessible by clicking on a map.  A detailed information screen appears for each country, including population data and major cities.  However, the reviewer points out that the population growth data is presented as a graph, which might not be as engaging for all users.  The program's history sections are described as ""sketchy"" and ""misleading"" in some cases, with the reviewer suggesting that the program is better used as a research stimulus rather than a definitive reference.  A key drawback is the need for two floppy disks, which would require a second disk drive for optimal use.

**MyPaint Prism Computer Products (£34.95):**

This review describes a painting program for children.  The reviewer praises the program's ease of use, friendly interface, and colorful icons.  It's described as an excellent program for developing mouse control and familiarity with computer icons.  The program's features include various drawing tools (thick/thin lines, symmetry, fill, etc.), a palette of 12 colors, a rainbow brush, and an undo/clear function.  The program allows saving images in IFF format, although the save system is described as somewhat fragile.  A unique feature is the ability to load line drawings from disk, which can be used as templates or ""surprise"" images that reveal themselves as the user paints over them.  The reviewer highlights the inclusion of sound samples, specifically mentioning the whale song as particularly impressive.  The review concludes by noting that while the program is good for initial use and fun, the long-term interest might wane once all the images are completed.

**Conclusion Section (Kate's):**

A separate section, titled ""Conclusion,"" provides a summary of the MyPaint program.  The reviewer emphasizes the program's value as a starting point for children learning computer painting and mouse control.  The reviewer also notes the program's entertaining aspects, similar to using paper and crayons.  The only drawback mentioned is the potential for waning interest after the user has completed all the included images.

**Additional Information:**

The page also includes a list of available programs and their prices, along with contact information for the retailer.  The page is formatted with various graphics and images related to the software being reviewed.

157,"This page is a technical article from a magazine, likely *Amiga Format*, discussing collision detection in the game *Menace*.  The article is focused on the specifics of how the game's collision detection works, particularly highlighting the use of Amiga hardware features and the trade-offs between different approaches.

**Detailed Description:**

The article begins by explaining the general concept of collision detection in games, noting that it's a common task.  It then dives into the specific collision detection methods used in *Menace*, focusing on how the game handles collisions between the player's ship, foreground elements, and aliens.

**Key Points:**

* **Hardware Sprite Collisions:** The article emphasizes the Amiga's hardware ability to detect collisions between sprites (like the player's ship) and bit planes.  It explains how *Menace* leverages this by using specific bit planes (1, 3, and 5 for the background; 2, 4, and 6 for the foreground) to define the game's layers.
* **Pixel-Perfect Detection:** The article describes the ""pixel-perfect"" collision detection method used, where a collision occurs when a single pixel of one object overlaps a single pixel of another.
* **Collision Detection Routines:** The article details the software routines used to implement the collision detection, including the use of the CLXCON register to control which bit planes are checked for collisions.
* **Ship-to-Foreground Collisions:**  A specific section discusses the nuances of detecting collisions between the player's ship and foreground elements, highlighting a quirk in the initial implementation that was later corrected to avoid unintended consequences (like losing energy when the player's ship collided with its own missiles).
* **Generous Collision Detection:** The article advocates for ""generous"" collision detection, where the player can stray slightly into objects before a collision is registered.  This is contrasted with the more precise, but potentially less forgiving, hardware-based detection.
* **Collision Mask:** The article shows an example of a collision mask (Figure 1) used in the game *Blood Money*, illustrating how a simplified mask can be used to improve the detection process.
* **Hardware Registering:** The article explains how the CLXCON register is used to control which bit planes are checked for collisions.
* **What Hit What?:** The article also addresses the issue of determining which specific part of an object (e.g., a missile) collided with which specific part of another object (e.g., an alien).

**Review Rating (if applicable):**

There is no explicit review rating.  The article is a technical description of the game's mechanics, not a review of the game itself.


**Overall:**

The page provides a detailed technical explanation of the collision detection methods used in the game *Menace*, focusing on the use of Amiga hardware features and the trade-offs between different approaches.  It's aimed at a technical audience interested in game development or Amiga computer programming.
"
158,"This page is a technical article from a computer game programming magazine, likely from the 1980s or early 1990s, focusing on the programming techniques used in the game ""Menace.""  It details the coordinate checking and collision detection algorithms used in the game.

**Section 1: Coordinate Checking**

The article begins by explaining the challenges of pixel-perfect collision detection in games.  It argues that checking every pixel of a missile against every pixel of an alien is computationally expensive and would slow down the game significantly.  Instead, the game uses a ""box"" method, defining rectangular areas around the objects.  The article highlights the limitations of this approach, noting that aliens and missiles don't always fit neatly into these boxes, leading to rough collision detection.  It then describes how the game uses a single coordinate for small missiles, checking if that coordinate falls within the alien's box.

**Section 2: Figure 2 and Collision Detection Optimization**

The article includes a diagram (Figure 2) illustrating a small alien and a missile.  It explains how the game handles the case where the missile is far from the alien's center but still within the box.  The article proposes storing a specific collision box size for each alien type to improve accuracy and efficiency.  It also discusses how the calculation of whether a missile is within a box can be made more efficient by using constant numbers instead of checking every pixel.

**Section 3: Make it Simpler**

This section introduces a more efficient method for collision detection.  It suggests combining mask detection (using the blitter to check if a missile overlaps with an alien) with coordinate detection.  This approach leverages the Amiga's hardware blitter, which can quickly perform bitwise operations.  The article explains how using the BZERO bit in the DMACONR register allows for a fast check to see if the result of the blit operation is all zeroes, indicating a collision.  This method significantly reduces the number of comparisons needed, improving the game's performance.

**Section 4: Love Missile F-111**

This section describes the different types of missiles in the game (""Normal missile,"" ""Cannon,"" ""Laser,"" and ""Outrider"") and their characteristics (range, speed, and power).  It also explains the collision detection methods used for these missiles against aliens and other game elements.

**Section 5: Completing the Code**

This section notes that the complete code for the game's level one is not included in this month's issue but will be in the next.  It also mentions that the article will cover ancillary aspects of the game's programming in the following month, such as music, memory management, and disk routines.

**Overall:**

The article is a detailed explanation of the programming techniques used for collision detection in a video game.  It focuses on optimizing performance by using efficient algorithms and leveraging the capabilities of the Amiga's hardware.  The article's technical nature and focus on specific programming details suggest it's aimed at other programmers working on similar games.
