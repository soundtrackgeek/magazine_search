**Section 1: ""The Real Thing â Or Artifice?""**

This section is a discussion about the nature of art versus commercial imagery, specifically advertising.  The text argues that while some believe commercial imagery inherently debases art, others see advertising as a powerful creative force.  It highlights how some artworks from the 13th and 14th centuries could be considered advertisements in their own right.  The piece also touches on the evolution of art forms, particularly in relation to commercial purposes, and the role of individual ideas and technical execution in art.  The author, Brigitte van Reuben, offers a perspective on the changing relationship between art and advertising, noting the increasing use of computer-generated imagery in television commercials.

This is an image of a Coke can, rendered in a pixelated, almost graphic novel style.  The image is a detailed, almost embroidered, representation of a Coke can. The accompanying text describes the artwork as a deliberate rejection of the typical advertising approach.  The artist, Hugh Riley, is said to have avoided the usual ""tickling the taste buds"" approach of advertising, instead focusing on the simple shapes and colors of the can itself.  The text suggests the artwork is an anti-advertisement, highlighting the object's inherent value rather than its commercial associations.

**Section 3: ""Shoes"" (by Hugh Riley)**

The text emphasizes the strong visual and comedic elements of the piece.
