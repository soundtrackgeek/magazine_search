The review, written by a reviewer identified as ""F1 Licenceware,"" gives a mixed assessment of the game.

* **Difficulty:** The reviewer describes the demo version as starting easy but quickly becoming challenging, requiring precise placement of directions for the ball.  The reviewer also notes the difficulty of changing directions once set.
* **Graphics:** Despite the initial graphics, the reviewer praises the pretty graphics that appear later in the game.
