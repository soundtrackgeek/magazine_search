This allows for more complex maneuvers and platforming challenges.  The reviewer also notes that the game's platforming elements are well-designed, and the player doesn't need to kill enemies by jumping on them, but rather uses the football for this purpose.

**Positive Aspects:**

The review praises the game's playability, describing it as having ""bags of it.""  It also notes the game's colorful graphics and the enjoyable, cartoonish atmosphere.  The reviewer also mentions the game's innovative ball control system and the variety of power-ups and collectibles.
