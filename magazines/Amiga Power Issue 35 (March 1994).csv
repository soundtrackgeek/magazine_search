**Review Rating:** The game is given a score of 10/00.

**Game Overview:** The review highlights ""Sabre Team"" as a variant of the earlier game ""Laser Squad,"" but with real people and situations.  Players take control of a team of up to four SAS operatives in various scenarios, typically involving rescuing hostages and eliminating terrorists. The game is played from an isometric perspective, allowing players to see their surroundings and the positions of enemies and hostages.  The game's graphics are described as detailed and worthy of an arcade game.

**Gameplay Details:** The review emphasizes the importance of line-of-sight rules in gameplay.  Players must consider where their troops can see to effectively strategize.  Action points are crucial, determined by health and equipment load.  Activities like walking, changing weapons, shooting, and using grenades all consume action points.  The reviewer notes that the game's pace is significantly faster than the original version, taking only a few seconds to move terrorists and hostages, compared to the original's five minutes.  This faster pace is a key improvement.

**Positive Aspects:** The review praises the game's sound, music, and speed of gameplay, as well as its impressive graphics.  The reviewer also highlights the professional feel of the game, noting the quality of the voice acting and the realistic situations.

**Negative Aspects:** While the music is praised, the reviewer criticizes the lack of an option to turn off the music and sound effects.  The limited number of missions (only five) is also a significant drawback.

The reviewer praises the game's power-ups and collectibles, which are often represented by sweets, apples, and ice cream cones.

This allows for more complex maneuvers and platforming challenges.  The reviewer also notes that the game's platforming elements are well-designed, and the player doesn't need to kill enemies by jumping on them, but rather uses the football for this purpose.

**Positive Aspects:**

The review praises the game's playability, describing it as having ""bags of it.""  It also notes the game's colorful graphics and the enjoyable, cartoonish atmosphere.  The reviewer also mentions the game's innovative ball control system and the variety of power-ups and collectibles.

**Negative Aspects:**

**Technical Aspects:** The review discusses the game's interface, which is described as simple and easy to use.  The manual is noted as being concise, with only four pages.

The review emphasizes that the game's strengths lie in its visuals and puzzles, but its plot and lack of innovation are weaknesses.
