7,"This page from Amiga Power magazine, dated July 1995, features reviews and game descriptions for two different Amiga computer games: ""Springtime"" and ""Missile Command.""

**Springtime**

* **Authors:** Joker, Brenco, and Fabio Corica
* **Genre:** Point-and-click adventure, shoot-'em-ups, beat-'em-ups, platform games, business sims, and flight sims.
* **Description:** The game is described as a ""puzzler"" with an ""original idea.""  The player controls a small, surreal creature that must manipulate a 3-dimensional object.  The key mechanic involves navigating the creature around a spring-based environment, where walking into walls causes the object to rotate.  The game's difficulty is described as ""simple"" but with a ""handy feature"" to help players learn the mechanics.  The game has levels, and a ""help"" block at the start of each level provides hints or allows the player to restart the level without losing a life.  The game's goal is to eventually land the object on a cross.
* **Review:** The review highlights the game's originality and simplicity, emphasizing the unique 3D manipulation aspect.

**Circus**

* **Author:** Graham Mackarel
* **Genre:**  A conversion of an older game.
* **Description:**  The review describes the game as ""phenomenally popular and successful.""  It's a simple game where the player uses the mouse to control a clown jumping on a seesaw to catch other objects and propel them.  The goal is to destroy balloons and collect bonuses.  The review notes that the game's instructions are difficult to understand, but the gameplay itself is straightforward.

**Missile Command**

* **Author:** Max Bithead
* **Genre:**  Missile Command
* **Description:**  The review describes the game as a ""good version"" of the classic arcade game.  The reviewer notes that the game is almost flawless, but the only issue is that the missiles explode almost instantly upon being fired, which removes some of the strategic element.  The game uses the mouse to control the crosshair and the left mouse button to fire missiles.  The space bar pauses the game, and the 's' key turns the sound off.
* **Review:** The review praises the game's near-flawless execution, but criticizes the instant missile explosion, which reduces the strategic depth.


The page layout includes screenshots and graphics of the games, along with the game's title, author, and genre information.  The page also includes a small graphic of the game's character or environment.  The overall design is typical of a gaming magazine from the 1990s.
