40,"This page is a review of a video game called TFX, published by Ocean, for Amiga computers.  The review, which appears in a magazine called Amiga Power, is dated May 1995.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by noting that the game's name, TFX, is unexplained.  It runs on Amiga 1200 and 4000 systems, and requires six disk swaps to load.  The reviewer states that the game's loading process involves a series of seemingly pointless screen displays, focusing on the USAF Fighter Weapons School.  The review also mentions the game's price (£40) and that the release date is yet to be determined (TBA).

**Review Content:**

The reviewer describes a surreal experience during the game's loading process, comparing it to a visit to Hell, where the reviewer imagines a pub filled with smokers and old television shows playing on a stereo.  The reviewer's actual experience, however, is of a game with a frustrating loading process.

**Gameplay Details:**

The review highlights the game's aircraft selection, mentioning three planes available to the player.  The reviewer also notes the game's Eurofighter 2000, which is described as a futuristic European fighter jet.  The review also discusses the Lockheed F-22 Superstar, a carrier-based fighter jet, and the Lockheed F-117A Stealth Fighter.  The reviewer points out that the F-117A is a ground attack aircraft.

**Technical Aspects:**

The review criticizes the game's graphics, stating that they are less impressive than the PC versions of the game.  The reviewer also notes the game's frustrating loading process, which involves numerous disk swaps and a long wait time.  The game's graphics are described as dull compared to the PC versions.  The review also mentions the game's use of disk swaps, which are necessary to load the game.  The reviewer also notes that the game's graphics are dull compared to PC versions.

**Overall Impression:**

The review expresses significant frustration with the game's loading process, which involves numerous disk swaps and a long wait time.  The reviewer also criticizes the game's graphics, which are described as dull compared to PC versions.  The review concludes with a negative overall impression of the game.

"
41,"This page is from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, featuring a review section titled ""Game Reviews.""  Specifically, it's a review of a game called ""TFX.""

The review, ""Certain Death,"" is on page 41.  The review gives a mixed assessment of the game.  While praising the game's graphics and atmosphere, the reviewer criticizes some aspects, such as the game's lack of ""knockabout fun"" compared to other games, and the persistent ""pointless pictures"" that detract from the experience.  The reviewer also notes the game's realistic simulation elements, which, while appreciated by some, might not be appealing to all players.

The review highlights the following aspects of the game:

* **Graphics and Atmosphere:** The reviewer describes the game's landscape as fading gradually into the distance, with city lights twinkling below.  The plane's logo and weapons are detailed, and the smoke trails from missiles are convincing.  The ""virtual cockpit"" view is also praised.
* **Gameplay Mechanics:** The reviewer discusses the use of laser-guided bombs, in-flight refueling, carrier landings, and HARM radar-seeking missiles.  The game's aerial combat is described as ""nail-biting.""
* **Technical Aspects:** The reviewer notes the game's performance on the Amiga 4000, mentioning that while the screen updates aren't as smooth as on a top-end PC, the detail options can be maxed out for a playable experience.  The reviewer also mentions the importance of disk swapping and memory for a smooth experience.
* **Overall Impression:** The reviewer concludes that the game is an excellent simulation, but it's not for everyone.  It's a cold, ruthless simulation that doesn't cater to casual players.

The page also includes screenshots and illustrations of the game's interface and gameplay, providing visual representations of the reviewer's points.  There's a section about the ""Maverick"" aspect of the game, which suggests a more modern weaponry-focused experience.  The reviewer also mentions the game's ""theatre of operations"" selection, which is a notable feature.

The page also includes a small, separate review of another game, which is not as detailed as the main review.  This review is more focused on the game's less appealing aspects.

The overall tone of the review is critical in some areas, but also appreciative of the game's strengths.  There's no explicit rating given, but the review's length and detail suggest it's a significant piece of coverage.

**Review Rating:** The review concludes with a rating of 55%.

**Review Summary:** The reviewer initially finds the game intriguing, praising the attention to detail in the animation, scenery, and characters.  However, the reviewer quickly notes that the game becomes repetitive and predictable after a few hours of play.  The core gameplay loop of exploring levels, collecting items, and fighting enemies is described as simple, but the lack of significant variation in the levels and character progression leads to a sense of sameness.

**Specific Points of the Review:**

* **Gameplay:** The reviewer describes the gameplay as straightforward, involving collecting items, using weapons, and bribing enemies to progress through levels.  The mouse control is praised as better than a joystick.  The game's levels are split into screens, with multiple exits in some cases, encouraging exploration.

* **Difficulty:** The reviewer finds the game too easy, especially after the first few levels.  The game's difficulty is described as ""stupidly hard"" for a creature encountered at the end of level five.
* **Repetition:** The core complaint is the repetitive nature of the gameplay.  The reviewer notes that the levels become very similar after a while, and the same actions are repeated.
* **A1200 Compatibility Issue:**  A significant negative point is that the game does not work on the A1200, which is a major disappointment for Amiga users.
