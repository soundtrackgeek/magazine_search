64,"This page is a review, titled ""BIG MAC & CHIPS,"" of the A-MAX, a new hardware add-on for the Amiga computer.  The review, by Jason Holborn, appears in *Amiga Format* magazine, issue 64.

The review discusses the A-MAX's ability to emulate the Macintosh, specifically the Macintosh Plus.  It highlights the long-awaited arrival of a hardware-based Amiga Macintosh emulator.  The reviewer notes the emulator's simple objective: to transform the Amiga into a Macintosh Plus.

The review delves into the setup process, emphasizing that A-MAX isn't a plug-and-play device.  It requires obtaining Mac ROMs and transferring the Mac's operating system (Finder) to an A-MAX compatible disk.  The reviewer explains the copyright restrictions that prevent A-MAX from including the Mac OS, requiring users to obtain a copy themselves.  The review also details the process of transferring Mac disk contents to an A-MAX disk, noting the need for a Mac second drive and the use of a special multi-speed drive.

The review also compares the Amiga's capabilities with the Macintosh's, particularly in the area of desktop publishing (DTP).  It points out that Macintosh software is often more powerful than similar Amiga software, especially in graphics-intensive applications like DTP.  The reviewer uses Professional Page as an example, comparing its redraw speed on the Macintosh to a similar Amiga package.  The review concludes that the Macintosh has almost completely captured the DTP market with its professional DTP packages.

The review also mentions the ease of setup, contrasting it with other similar units for the ST.  It notes that the initial setup is straightforward and quick.  The review also touches on the Amiga's adaptability to read various Mac formats, citing DOS-2-DOS as an example.

There's also a smaller, separate section on the page, likely an advertisement or related article, featuring a graphic of a Macintosh screen displaying text that says ""BIG MAC"" and ""Apple's Macintosh"" in a blue font.  This section also mentions that Apple's Macintosh is regarded by many as a ""cult"" computer.  A small graphic of a computer screen is also present.

* **COMPUTER OPPONENTS:**  This section focuses on strategies for dealing with computer-controlled opponents.  It suggests using 4-4-2 or 5-3-2 formations for better control, and warns against using 4-3-3 or 4-2-4 formations against the USSR team, as they are very fast.
