38,"This page is a game review for ""Life & Death,"" a computer game published by Mindscape.  The review, appearing in *Amiga Power* magazine in July 1991, is spread across several paragraphs and includes screenshots and game-related imagery.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing the game's premise: a player takes on the role of an abdominal surgery specialist at Toolworks General Hospital.  The player must diagnose patients' internal problems, ranging from intestinal gas to appendicitis, using X-rays and ultrasound.  The review highlights the game's unusual focus on the medical profession as a gameplay mechanic.

**Gameplay Details:**

The review details the process of diagnosis and surgery.  It emphasizes the importance of choosing the right surgical team members, the role of assistants, and the potential for mistakes.

**Review Rating (Implied):**

While not explicitly stating a numerical rating, the review presents a mixed assessment.  It acknowledges the game's originality and bravery in its concept, but also criticizes its over-simplification of the diagnosis aspect and the unforgiving nature of the surgical procedures.  The review suggests that the game's initial novelty wears off after a while, and that the game's focus on realism might not be appropriate for a computer game.

**Technical Aspects:**

The review mentions the game's copyright date (1988) and the lengthy conversion process to the Amiga platform.  This suggests a potential delay between the PC version's release and the Amiga version.

**Author and Publisher:**

The review credits Simon J. Beal as the author and Mindscape as the publisher of the game.

46,"This page is a section from a magazine, likely a gaming magazine, focused on the game MegaTraveller.  It's a detailed article, providing information on character creation, career opportunities, and the various services available within the game.

**Section 1: Creating Characters and Parties**

This section provides guidance on creating characters for the game.  It details the importance of balancing character attributes, specifically:

* **Dexterity (DEX):**  A minimum rating of 8 is recommended for all characters, as lower ratings significantly hinder performance.
* **Endurance (END):**  A minimum of 9 is required for characters to use oxygen effectively in non-atmospheric environments.  Higher ratings (10 or 11) are beneficial for combat characters.
* **Strength (STR):**  This attribute determines physical power and the weight of equipment a character can carry.  Land-based services require higher strength ratings for effective combat.
* **Intelligence (INT):**  Combined with Education (EDU), this determines the number of skills a character can acquire during their career.  A minimum of 7 is recommended.
* **Education (EDU):**  A minimum of 7 is crucial for character development.
* **Social Standing (SOC):**  Middle ratings (6 or 7) are ideal for trading skills.  Lower scores can make communication with Non-Player Characters (NPCs) difficult.

**Section 2: Career Opportunities – A Guide to the Services**

This section details the advantages and disadvantages of joining different services in the game:

* **Imperial Navy:**  Excellent for starship flight and combat skills.  Has a better cash and benefits system than other services.  However, ground combat skills are limited.
* **Marines:**  Excellent ground combat training, and some space combat skills.  Social skills are also developed, which helps in conversations with NPCs.  Ranks are relatively easy to advance.  However, they have the lowest life expectancy and limited experience in navigation, piloting, and vehicle operation.
* **Army:**  Good for both ground and space combat skills.  Vehicle operation and tactics are well-trained.  Ranks are easily advanced.
* **Scouts:**  All-round training, with a focus on space flight and combat.  Ground movement and combat are also well-covered.  Re-enlistment is almost always granted, and they have the best benefits, especially regarding cash.
* **Merchants:**  Develop excellent trading skills.  May receive starship piloting training, but ground combat training and promotion chances are very limited.

**Section 3: General Notes**

This section provides additional information about character progression:

* **Re-enlistment:**  Re-enlisting for a fifth term in a military branch can lead to a loss of points in Strength, Dexterity, and Endurance.  After nine terms, advancing age also reduces Intelligence ratings.
* **Skills:**  Certain skills are acquired during a character's military career but are not used in MegaTraveller 1.  These should not be selected, as they waste skill points.  Other skills are frequently used, and should be selected when possible.

The page also includes several small images, likely screenshots of the game's interface, illustrating the game's features and atmosphere.  The overall tone is informative and practical, aimed at helping players understand the game's mechanics and make informed decisions about character creation and service selection.

76,"This page is from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, featuring game reviews.  Specifically, it's a review section from the July 1991 issue.

The page contains two reviews:

**1. Arnhem:**

* **Rating:**  The review is highly critical, concluding with a ""sad relic from a past era"" and stating that even wargamers will be disappointed. The rating is implicitly a very low score, likely below 50%.
* **Summary:**  The reviewer, Jonathan Davies, criticizes the game's poor quality, especially considering the Amiga's capabilities.  They find the conversion from a Spectrum game to Amiga to be inadequate, with the graphics and instructions being particularly lacking.  The reviewer notes the game's reliance on outdated 8-bit conventions, which doesn't translate well to the Amiga's capabilities.  The review highlights the game's primitive nature and lack of exploitation of the Amiga's potential.

**2. Les Manley in Search for the King:**

* **Rating:**  The review is mixed. While acknowledging some positive aspects, like the polished visuals and individual character designs, it also points out flaws, such as the game's poor structure and the awkward combination of text and mouse input.  The review doesn't explicitly give a numerical rating.
* **Summary:** The reviewer praises the game's visual presentation, character animation, and attention to detail.  However, they criticize the game's clunky user interface, which tries to combine point-and-click elements with a text-based system.  The review also notes the game's lengthy intro sequence, which, while establishing a sense of quality, doesn't compensate for the game's overall structure.  The reviewer draws a comparison to Lucasfilm's *Monkey Island*, highlighting the contrast in quality and design between the two games.  The review also touches on the game's American-style humor and the odd disclaimer about fictional characters.
