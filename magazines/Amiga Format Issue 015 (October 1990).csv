185,"This page is a review of the KCS PC PowerBoard, a hardware-based PC emulator for the Amiga 500.  The review, by Andy Storrer, is titled ""Crossing the Big Blue Horizon.""  The overall tone is critical, advising readers not to rush to buy a cheap PC, but instead to consider the KCS PowerBoard as an alternative.

The review begins with a description of the PowerBoard's functionality.  It effectively transforms the Amiga into an IBM-compatible PC, using 1MB of on-board RAM and a compact 6"" x 3"" form factor.  The card plugs into the Amiga's RAM expansion slot.  Crucially, the PowerBoard bypasses the Amiga's usual BIOS routines, optimizing performance by configuring screen handling as direct screen I/O.  This allows PC programs that bypass BIOS to work directly with the hardware.  The review highlights the significant effort put into the development of the board by Dutch developers KCS, who have worked on it for over 18 months.  The review notes that the board uses the RAM slot intended for dynamic memory chips, a method that surprised Commodore engineers.

The review then details the setup process, starting with loading a boot routine that configures video modes, disk drives, and peripherals.  It emphasizes the need to specify which disk drives will be used as PC devices, and that the Amiga's internal drive can be configured as a double-sided PC drive (720K).  The review also mentions the ability to add external 3.5"" or 5.25"" drives and to partition hard drives for both Amiga and PC use.  It also notes that the board doesn't support all PC peripherals, such as expansion slots for custom mice or scanners.

The ""Getting the Look"" section discusses the PC video modes supported by the PowerBoard, including mono MDA and four-color CGA.  It notes that the board allows the use of the Amiga's 4096 colors to replace the standard PC CGA colors.  However, the review points out potential problems with EGA and VGA modes due to memory limitations and the need for additional memory (2MB) to maintain optimal speed.

The ""Above: The KCS PC Powerboard"" section shows a picture of the board's circuit layout.

The ""Last Lap"" section describes the final initialization process, focusing on assigning communication ports for PC use (serial mice, printers, modems).  It explains how to configure ports, baud rates, and reset proof printer buffers.

The review concludes with a recommendation to consider the KCS PowerBoard instead of a generic cheap PC.  The review rating is not explicitly stated, but the overall tone suggests a positive assessment of the board's functionality, despite some limitations.

"
196,"This page contains Amiga-specific code examples and explanations related to resource allocation and deallocation.  It's a technical document, likely from a programming manual or tutorial.

The page describes two key routines, `begin_block()` and `end_block()`, designed to handle resource allocation and deallocation in a structured way.  These routines are crucial for managing resources like libraries, ports, and devices in an Amiga operating system environment.

**Listing 1 (begin_block()):** This routine is responsible for allocating resources.  It iterates through a resource vector (an array of resource identifiers). For each resource, it calls the `allocate_resource()` function. If `allocate_resource()` encounters an error (returns `TRUE`), it immediately deallocates all previously allocated resources in reverse order to prevent resource leaks.  This is a crucial error-handling mechanism.

**Listing 2 (end_block()):** This routine handles the deallocation of resources in a normal, error-free scenario. It iterates through the resource vector in reverse order, calling `deallocate_resource()` for each resource.

**Listing 3:** This listing shows the `allocate_resource()` function, which is a crucial part of the resource management process. It's a large `switch` statement that maps function numbers (likely representing different resources) to specific allocation code.  Each `case` in the `switch` statement corresponds to a particular resource, and the code within each case handles the allocation of that resource.  The code includes error checking (e.g., checking if `OpenLibrary` succeeded).

**Listing 4:** This listing shows the `deallocate_resource()` function, which is the counterpart to `allocate_resource()`.  It's another `switch` statement that maps function numbers to deallocation code.  Each `case` deallocates the corresponding resource.

**Overall Approach:** The author advocates for a structured approach to resource management, using a resource vector to maintain a list of allocated resources.  This approach ensures that resources are allocated and deallocated in a controlled manner, preventing errors and resource leaks.  The use of a `switch` statement allows for easy addition of new resources without modifying the core allocation/deallocation logic.

**Review/Rating:** There is no explicit review rating.  The page is purely technical documentation, providing code examples and explanations.

**Additional Notes:** The page mentions the Coverdisk, suggesting that there might be more complete examples or related information on a supplementary disk.  The use of `#define` labels and the modular design of the code suggest a well-structured and maintainable approach to resource management in an Amiga environment. The page also highlights the benefits of this approach, such as preventing mis-ordering of resources when new code is added.
