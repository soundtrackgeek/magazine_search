**Review Summary:**

The reviewer praises the game's strategic elements, AI, and command interface, calling them ""good.""

The reviewer notes that the single-player experience is strong, but the multiplayer aspect is weak.

**Review Rating:**

The review gives the game a 73% rating, categorized as ""good.""

**Game Description (from the review):**

The review describes ""Imperium Galactica II"" as a turn-based space strategy game, similar in gameplay to ""Master of Orion II.""  The game allows players to explore the galaxy, consolidate power, research technology, and engage in diplomacy and warfare with other empires.  The game features three playable races in the single-player mode, with more available in multiplayer.  The review highlights the 3D space combat as a strength, but notes that ground combat is limited to tanks.  The reviewer also mentions the game's diplomacy screen, which allows for trading information and using spies.

The review explicitly states that the multiplayer mode is a significant weakness, with simulated combat and limited speed control.  The reviewer contrasts this with the single-player experience, which is deemed strong.

**Visuals and Sound:**

The review mentions the game's visuals as ""very good,"" but notes a minor issue with the absence of suns on the starmaps.  The sound is described as ""partially implemented,"" with some screens featuring guttural speech from other races, but the diplomatic screen only provides written translations.

**Overall:**

The review provides a balanced assessment of ""Imperium Galactica II,"" highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses.  It emphasizes the game's strong single-player experience but points out the limitations of the multiplayer mode.  The review concludes with a final verdict and a summary of the game's pros and cons.

98,"This page is a review of the video game ""Tachyon: The Fringe"" from PC Gamer magazine, dated July 2000.

The review is presented in a standard magazine layout, with a prominent headline and accompanying graphics.

**Review Summary:**

The review gives the game an 82% rating, calling it ""Excellent.""  The reviewer, Li C. Kuo, praises the game's atmosphere, engaging story elements, and the personality of the main character, Bruce Campbell.  However, the review also points out significant flaws, particularly the poor save-game system and the somewhat linear gameplay.

**Review Details:**

* **Gameplay:** The reviewer notes that the game is similar to ""Privateer,"" with players spending time between missions checking job boards.  However, unlike ""Origin,"" ""Tachyon"" is more linear, with clear objectives.  Missions range from standard escort/destroy tasks to more unusual, unorthodox sorties.  A notable mission involves rendezvousing with a spy, but the situation becomes complicated by multiple ships claiming to be the spy, leading to a tense decision-making moment.  Multiplayer matches are highlighted as creative, featuring a ""Basewars"" mode where teams defend starbases and compete to develop technologies and weapons.

* **Story and Characters:** The review emphasizes the engaging story, which revolves around a conflict between the Bora and Galspan corporations.  The player's role is to rebuild their reputation and clear their name after being framed for murder.  The reviewer specifically praises the inclusion of Bruce Campbell, who provides memorable one-liners and adds personality to the game.

* **Technical Aspects:** The review mentions the ""slide"" button, which allows players to turn their fighter in all axes while traveling in the same direction.  The reviewer also points out the game's graphics and sound, but doesn't elaborate on them.

* **Criticisms:** The most significant criticism is the poor save-game system.  The reviewer states that progress is automatically saved when entering a starbase, but a backup requires exiting to the main menu.  The game is also described as somewhat linear, lacking the open-endedness of some other space combat games.  The inter-stellar travel is also described as tedious.

* **Overall Impression:** Despite the flaws, the reviewer concludes that ""Tachyon"" is a solid game with a good story and enjoyable gameplay.  The reviewer hopes the game receives the recognition it deserves.


**Additional Sections:**

* **""Bruce in Space"":** This section features quotes from Bruce Campbell, providing a humorous and memorable touch to the review.

* **""If you have the money..."":** This section discusses the option of hiring a ""wingman"" in the game, highlighting the game's economic aspects.

105,"This page is a review of the video game NASCAR 2000, published in PC Gamer magazine, July 2000.  The review is rated 70% and deemed ""Good.""

The review begins with a brief introduction highlighting that Electronic Arts (EA) is stepping into the stock car racing genre, traditionally dominated by Sierra's NASCAR series.  The reviewer notes that EA's previous NASCAR Revolution game was poorly received.

The review then delves into the game's features, including:

* **Graphics:** The game is praised for its impressive visuals, dynamic lighting, and rich track textures, which create a sense of speed and realism.  The reviewer notes that the frame rates are smooth.  However, some ""cheesy"" crash effects are mentioned as a drawback.
* **Sound:** The audio effects are described as immersive, but the reviewer notes that the game's sense of realism diminishes once the sound is considered.
* **Gameplay:** The game offers a variety of options, including full weekend events, quick races, championship calendars, and a ""Race Against the King"" mode featuring Richard Petty.  An online matchmaking service is also mentioned, though limited.  The game features 18 real-world tracks, over 30 active NASCAR drivers, and a comprehensive collection of official and fantasy courses.
* **Car Handling and Physics:** The reviewer notes that the car handling is reasonably well-modeled, but it's difficult to generate realistic oversteering slides.  The physics modeling is a step up from the previous Revolution game, but still falls short of capturing the true dynamics of modern stock car racing.
* **Garage Menu and Damage:** The garage menu is described as comprehensive, but many of the adjustments are ineffective.  The damage implementation is also criticized as ambiguous and unrealistic, with ""velcro"" walls that pull cars to a halt regardless of impact.
* **AI:** The game's AI routines are deemed ""highly dubious.""

The review concludes with a ""Final Verdict"" section, summarizing the game's strengths and weaknesses.  The positive aspects include cutting-edge graphics, a good selection of licensed tracks and drivers, and a sense of speed.  However, the negative aspects include flawed AI, unrealistic physics, and damage modeling.  The review ultimately concludes that the game is an improvement over Revolution, but doesn't reach the same level of quality as Sierra's NASCAR titles.  The reviewer suggests that fans of relaxed-realism racing games will enjoy the game.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing the game as the final military simulation from MicroProse, and notes that the game's release was a disappointing end to a line of popular simulation games.  It highlights the game's single-player and multiplayer modes, including a ""Fly Now"" mode, and the ability to customize missions using the Battle Builder.

108,"This page is a review of the video game ""Ka-52 Team Alligator,"" published in PC Gamer magazine, July 2000.

The review is presented in a standard magazine format, with a large headline and accompanying image of the game's helicopter.  The review includes a rating of 62% (""Above Average"").

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by highlighting that ""Ka-52 Team Alligator"" is the first helicopter simulator of the year, but it lacks teeth (meaning it doesn't have the features or depth of other similar games).  It's a follow-up to the 1999 game ""Team Apache,"" and features the Ka-52 Hokum gunships, Russia's advanced all-weather combat helicopter.  The game aims to provide a scalable flight model for both casual and veteran pilots.

**Gameplay and Features:**

The review praises the game's graphics engine, which is described as ""freshly upgraded Direct3D graphics engine,"" and the topographically rich background.  However, it criticizes the flight model as feeling ""like it's on rails"" with ""annoying defects"" like poor collision detection and a large joystick dead zone.  The avionics and radar systems are also described as simplified, designed for a wider audience.  The review notes the presence of ground effect, blade stall, and vortex ring state options for more advanced players.

**Campaign and Multiplayer:**

The review details the campaign missions, which are set in the former Soviet Republics of Belarus and Tajikistan.  The review notes that the campaigns are quite short, with only six missions to win the first campaign in Tajikistan.  The micro-management aspects are praised as a nice touch, but the limited campaign length and few multiplayer options (only 16 single co-op missions and four head-to-head scenarios) are considered a significant drawback for most players.  A mission builder would have been a welcome addition.

**Technical Aspects:**

The review mentions that the game crashed frequently on the reviewer's system, requiring the reviewer to turn down hardware acceleration.  This technical issue is a significant negative point.

**Review Conclusion:**

The reviewer concludes that while the game has attractive graphics and a comprehensive squad-based micro-management system, the short campaigns, simplistic flight model, poor pyrotechnics, and aircraft modeling, along with the technical issues, result in a game with limited depth.  The review recommends waiting for a better game in the genre.

**Reviewer's Experience:**

The review includes a personal anecdote from the reviewer, who experienced a Belarussian truck park being attacked by a Ka-52 rocket.  This anecdote is used to illustrate the game's lack of replay value.

**Overall:**

The review provides a detailed look at the game's strengths and weaknesses, focusing on the gameplay, campaign, multiplayer, and technical aspects.  The reviewer's experience and the final verdict clearly indicate a game that, while visually appealing, falls short in terms of depth and replayability.

The review, written by Li C. Kuo, gives the game a 24% rating, classifying it as a ""Don't Bother"" title.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by highlighting the game's attractive box art, contrasting it with the game's poor quality.  The game is described as an isometric view action/strategy game, similar to the real-time strategy game X-COM, but with sub-par graphics reminiscent of The Sims.  The gameplay involves controlling firefighters to put out fires in a 3D environment.

**Criticisms:**

The review criticizes several aspects of the game:

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The AI pathfinding is severely flawed, with firefighters frequently getting stuck on walls, furniture, and generally acting erratically.
* **Interface:** The interface is described as problematic, with some fire areas being too small to target effectively.
* **Graphics:** The graphics are considered cheesy and unconvincing, particularly the fire and water effects.
* **Audio:** The audio commentary during news broadcasts is repetitive and monotonous, playing the same lines over and over.
* **Gameplay Mechanics:** The review points out that firefighters can shoot extinguishers through walls, which is an unrealistic and illogical mechanic.
* **Overall Experience:** The reviewer concludes that the game is poorly designed and frustrating to play, despite the cool box art.

**Positive Aspects (Limited):**

While the review is overwhelmingly negative, a small positive is mentioned: the box art is considered ""cool.""  The game is also noted as teaching children that fire is dangerous.

**Final Verdict:**

* **Question 2:** A reader reports increased ping times (latency) after installing 64MB of PC-100 SDRAM.  The expert suggests that the problem is not likely the RAM itself, but rather the internet connection (Freei.net, a 56kbps modem).  The expert recommends testing the RAM by removing it and checking ping times again.  They also suggest using software to optimize modem speed, such as Winboost or Modem Booster.

**Section 2:  ""Dear Greg"" Column**

* **Expert Answer:** The expert responds with a somewhat unusual suggestion, advising the reader to use mimicry to show the children how their behavior is inappropriate.  The expert suggests acting in a strange way to get the parents to leave.

**Section 3:  ""Need Help?"" Column**

This section is a general ""Need Help?"" column, where readers can ask questions about hardware or personal problems.

* **Question 4:** A reader describes lock-up problems in 3D games with a 450MHz Pentium III, 128MB SDRAM, and an ATI Rage Fury (32MB) video card.  The expert suggests checking the AGP aperture size (64MB) in the BIOS and updating the BIOS if necessary.

138,"This is a review of the video game ""Rainbow Six Takes the Ghetto,"" published in *PC Gamer* magazine, July 2000.  The review, by T. Liam McDonald, is part of a larger ""Extended Play"" section.

The review begins by highlighting the game's five-mission structure and the developer's use of techniques to make the experience feel more substantial.  The reviewer criticizes the artificial difficulty, noting that the AI is overly aggressive, and that restrictive success parameters and forced extraction points create an overly punishing experience.

The review then moves into a detailed discussion of the game's strengths and weaknesses.  The reviewer praises the impressive location modeling, which is described as ""absolutely amazing"" and ""doubly difficult"" due to its realistic representation of real-world environments.  However, the reviewer notes that the inclusion of civilians in only the first mission is a missed opportunity to increase tension and challenge in the other missions.  The goals are described as straightforward but demanding, requiring complete success and survival of all hostages and civilians.

The reviewer also discusses the game's multiplayer aspects.  Eight new multiplayer maps are mentioned, including an ""underwater habitat"" level and a bunker-defense mission.  A new ""defend"" multiplayer mission type is also highlighted.  While the four new guns are noted, the reviewer emphasizes the utility for managing missions and mods as a more significant addition.  The reviewer states that this tool allows players to set up any mission type on any map and import/manage mod levels effectively.

The review concludes by praising the game's challenging levels and welcoming new features, but also mentioning a sea-related issue (though the exact nature of this issue is not specified).  The review also includes a brief description of a specific level, a London tube station, highlighting a terrorist-themed scenario.

148,"This page is from a PC Gamer magazine, specifically the July 2000 issue, and contains a review of three helicopter simulation games: Gunship!, Ka-52 Team Alligator, and Enemy Engaged: Comanche Vs Hokum.  The article is titled ""Rotary-Wing Roundup"" and is part of a ""Sim Column"" written by Andy Mahoood.

**Gunship! (Hasbro/MicroProse):**  The review gives Gunship! a negative assessment.  While praising its impressive pedigree (referencing the original and 2000 sequels), the reviewer criticizes the game's wonky gyro compass, which causes the helicopter to fly in the wrong direction.  The campaign missions are also criticized as poorly designed, with repetitive failed missions and counter-intuitive waypoint navigation and wingman management.  The game's graphics are described as ""juicy-looking,"" but the overall gameplay is deemed poorly conceived.  The reviewer notes the presence of an unlimited supply of SAM missiles for enemy ground targets, making the experience overly challenging and frustrating for players.

**Ka-52 Team Alligator (GT Interactive/Simis):**  The review of Ka-52 is mixed.  The game is praised for its realistic depiction of the Ka-52 Alligator gunship and its skirmishes set against an Eastern European backdrop.  However, the reviewer notes that the game is ""very long on style but somewhat short on substance.""  The Direct3D-enhanced terrain graphics are appreciated, but the short-lived semi-dynamic campaigns and broken flight model are considered flaws.  The game is deemed too difficult for novice players, but the reviewer suggests that a third-party flight model patch and custom missions could improve the experience.

**Enemy Engaged: Comanche Vs Hokum (Empire/Razorworks):**  This game receives a positive review.  The reviewer calls it the ""breakout sim"" of the three, praising its accurate flight modeling, sophisticated avionics, and detailed treatments of the RAH-66 Comanche and Ka-52 Hokum.  The game's dynamic campaigns and the option to import helos and campaigns from the previous Apache/Havoc game are highlighted as strengths.  The reviewer also notes that the game is user-friendly, with an option to scale back the difficulty and flight model fidelity.  The game is described as an impressive product from top to bottom.  The review mentions that the game was available in Europe for some time before its planned July 2000 release in the US.

The article also includes a brief introduction about modern helicopter warfare and the appeal of the helicopter simulation genre.  It mentions that three major releases are planned for the year, and that fans might encounter some challenges.  The page number (140) and the publication date (July 2000) are also included.
