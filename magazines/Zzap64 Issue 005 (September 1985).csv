* **Review Rating:**  High (Graphics 91%, Interaction 99%, Authenticity 96%, Overall 98%).
* **Description:**  The review praises the program's presentation, calling it ""fabulous.""  It's described as a true flight simulation, not just a game.  The Pilot's Handbook is a comprehensive manual covering various aspects of flight, including environmental factors, turbulence, and gliding.

The review, however, criticizes the enemy planes as unrealistic, the horizon update as ridiculously slow, and the sound as highly annoying.

**Flyer Fox:**

* **Review Rating:**  Not explicitly rated, but described as a flight simulation of sorts.
