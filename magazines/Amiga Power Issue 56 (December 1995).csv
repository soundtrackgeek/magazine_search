The reviewer notes that most flight simulators provide missions, flight plans, and predictable enemy routes, allowing for a more engaging experience.  Coala, however, leaves players to their own devices, with little guidance or meaningful objectives.

* **Lack of Depth:** The game is criticized for lacking depth and a compelling presentation.  The reviewer compares it unfavorably to other games, noting that the mechanics are present but the game feels unfinished.
* **Uninspired Gameplay:** The reviewer states that the game's gameplay is uninspired, with players often just flying around, and the battles are often over quickly.  The reviewer notes that the game lacks a sense of accomplishment, even when winning.
* **Limited Replay Value:** The reviewer notes that the game's repetitive missions and lack of structure lead to a lack of replay value.

**Additional Details:**

* **Gameplay Description:** The review describes the game as a 3D battlefield helicopter action simulator.  It details the controls, the view, and the general gameplay loop.
* **Comparison to Other Games:** The review frequently compares Coala to other flight simulators, highlighting the differences in structure, AI, and overall gameplay experience.

* **Overall Conclusion:** The review concludes that while Coala is an impressive demo, it falls short of being a complete game due to its lack of structure, repetitive missions, and lack of depth.
