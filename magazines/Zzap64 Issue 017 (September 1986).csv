**The Software:** The reviewer notes that the software is available on either tape or disk, but disk users are generally better served.  The reviewer highlights the quality of the sounds, particularly the realistic sounds like strings, electric piano, and organ.

The author explains that this is an unusual addition to the package, and that the quality of the SID component is significantly lower than the FM component.

The author notes that the software is somewhat slow, but highlights useful features like vibrato, pulse modulation, and portamento.  The author also mentions the ease of editing sounds using cursor keys.

* **Real-Time and Step-Time Music Entry:** The review details two methods of entering music: Real Time (playing as you go) and Step Time (entering notes individually).  The author notes that Real Time can be fun but prone to mistakes, while Step Time is more precise but tedious.  The author also mentions the lack of a musical stave in the Step Time mode.

* **Overall Assessment:** The author concludes by praising the software as one of the best SID packages on the market, despite the limitations of not being able to run music independently of the main program.  The author also encourages readers to contact them for further discussion.

**Evaluation of the Speech Commands:** The review analyzes the different commands within the software, specifically the ""*PITCH*"" and ""*SPEAK*"" commands.  It describes how the *PITCH* command attempts to optimize speech speed, but doesn't significantly improve the quality.

The review criticizes the educational program's length and difficulty in understanding the words.  The file-reading program is noted for its slow execution speed.

However, the review then proceeds to describe the Joyball's performance in various games, including Monty on the Run, Dropzone, Decathlon, International Karate, and Encounter.

* **Ergonomics and Durability:** The Joyball is described as somewhat cumbersome to hold, but effective on a table.  The review notes its durability, withstanding the rigors of the testing process.  However, the review also notes that right-handed users might find it slightly less convenient due to its design.

* **Overall Assessment:** The review concludes with a summary of the Joyball's strengths and weaknesses.  It praises the Joyball's responsiveness, sensitivity, and durability.

It's designed for ambidextrous users, held upright, which makes it slightly easier to use than the Joy Card.  A notable feature is that both fire buttons are operational, unlike the Joy Card.  The review notes the joystick isn't as responsive as the fire buttons, and it's not ideal for games requiring fast, precise movements like *Dropzone* or *International Karate*.

* **Ergonomics:** 78%
* **Durability:** 97%
* **Value for Money:** 83%
* **Overall:** 82%


**Euromax Pro Ace:**

However, the internal workings (leaf switches) remain the same.  The review criticizes the Pro Ace's joystick, noting slow response times and a long travel distance, making it feel like stirring thick syrup.  The fire button is described as responsive but sluggish.  The review concludes that the joystick is the weakest part of an otherwise strong controller.

* **Responsiveness:** Stick 45%, Button 71%
* **Ergonomics:** 85%
* **Durability:** 71%
* **Value for Money:** 47%
* **Overall:** 52%

The reviewer finds the micro switches to be a key feature, making the Micro Ace a good joystick, though not quite as good as the Micro Pro.  The stick is described as responsive, with positive micro-switch clicks during movement.  The review highlights the stick's durability, noting it survived various abuses.  The ergonomics are rated at 88%, considered comfortable but not ideal for extended waggling.  Responsiveness is rated at 90% for the stick and 71% for the buttons, with the buttons described as somewhat ""soggy.""  The value for money is rated at 88%, meaning it's comparable in price to the Arcade model but not quite in the same class.

**Euromax Micro Pro Review:**

The Micro Pro review is given a higher overall rating of 97%.  The reviewer initially notes a similarity in appearance and price to the Competition Pro, but points out the crucial difference of the micro switches.  The reviewer praises the responsiveness of the stick (98%) and buttons (99%), noting that while initially stiff, they wear in nicely.  Ergonomics are rated at 82%, considered suitable for most users but cumbersome for those with smaller hands.  Durability is rated at 97%, and the value for money is rated at 93%, making it a top-tier joystick in the reviewer's opinion.
