56,"This page is a review of the video game ""New York Warriors,"" published in Amiga Format magazine, December 1990.

The review, written by Andy Hutchinson, gives the game an overall score of 65%.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing the game's premise: a 2014 New York City overrun by organized crime, specifically the Church of the Third Coming (C3C).  Players take on the role of a Warrior, equipped with high-tech weaponry, tasked with battling their way through the city to a nuclear device planted at the World Trade Center. The game is a multi-directional ""blow-em-up"" style, featuring various urban locations and obstacles.  The gameplay involves encountering different enemy types, such as star-chucking Assassins and heavy-duty machine-gun-pumping Ramboids, who are positioned behind cover and in buildings.

**Graphics and Sound:**

The review notes the game's peculiar perspective, viewed from a high altitude, causing buildings to slant outwards.  The cityscape is described as gritty and run-down, with holes in the road and barbed wire.  Enemy detail and animation are mentioned, with the Warriors' sprite sometimes appearing to moonwalk.  The review highlights the graphical effects of weapons, including a grenade launcher, missile launcher, and flamethrower.  The sound effects are described as typical of the genre, with lots of explosions and bangs that add to the game's ""bloodthirsty"" appeal.

**Gameplay and Judgement:**

The review states that the game's gameplay is straightforward, but not original.  It follows a time-honored tradition of ""blood-letting en masse"" and has a ""one more go"" appeal.  The review points out that the game's length is appropriate, and the two-player option is fun.  However, the main criticism is the lack of originality, stating that similar games, like Ikari Warriors and Leathernecks, are superior and more original.  The Ninja Assassins, with their unlimited death stars, are also mentioned as not adding much to the gameplay.

**Rating and Conclusion:**

The overall rating of 65% reflects a mixed opinion. While the game is enjoyable and follows a familiar formula, its lack of originality is a significant drawback.  The review concludes by mentioning other games in the same genre and the overall lack of originality in the game.

76,"This page is a review of the video game ""Torvak the Warrior,"" published in Amiga Format magazine, December 1990.  The review is detailed and provides a comprehensive look at the game's core design, graphics, sound, lasting interest, and overall judgment.

**Core Design:** The review begins by describing the game's plot and the protagonist, Torvak, a warrior seeking revenge on an evil Necromancer.  It highlights the five levels Torvak must traverse, each filled with various enemies.  The review emphasizes the strategic placement of items like tombstones and the importance of timing in combat, particularly with the sword attacks.  It also notes the presence of various weapons and power-ups that can be collected and upgraded.  The review points out that the game's combat is more of a drawn-out war of attrition than a fast-paced action experience.

**Graphics and Sound:** The review praises the graphics for their variety and menacing atmosphere, particularly the level backgrounds.  It notes the presence of a good range of tunes, but none of them are particularly memorable or evocative of the mood of a grief-stricken warrior.

**Lasting Interest:** The review states that Torvak has fifteen levels and five guardians to overcome.  It acknowledges that the repetitive nature of the enemies and the lack of significant variation in combat can lead to a lack of excitement.  The review also mentions that the game's speed-ups and weapons can improve combat reactions, but the overall gameplay is repetitive.

**Judgment:** The review compares Torvak to other games in the genre, like Rastan, and finds that while the formula is similar, Torvak lacks the innovation and excitement of its predecessors.  It highlights the subdivision of levels into three sections with a guardian, and the familiar enemies.  The review concludes that the game's gameplay is limited to a lot of leaping and chopping, which hinders its staying power.

**Overall:** The review gives the game an overall score of 69%.  This indicates a mixed opinion, acknowledging some positive aspects but ultimately finding the game repetitive and lacking in innovation.

**Other elements:** The page also includes screenshots of the game, showing various game elements, including the character Torvak, enemies, and the game's interface.  There are also some humorous quotes and descriptions of the game's characters and situations.  The page also includes a section on the game's graphics, sound, intellect, addiction, and overall score.

93,"This page is a review of the video game ""Badlands,"" published in Amiga Format magazine, December 1990.

The review gives the game an overall rating of 46%.

**Graphics and Sound:** The reviewer describes the graphics as small, cartoon-like, and smooth, with good special effects for explosions.  The sound is described as a tense, somewhat generic tune that doesn't detract from the gameplay but doesn't add much either.

**Gameplay and Lasting Interest:** The game involves racing through various hazardous environments (a nuclear-blasted freeway, an oil refinery, a volcano, etc.) in vehicles that can be upgraded with weapons and other enhancements.  The reviewer notes the game's initial addictiveness due to the unique hazards and opponents, but that the novelty wears off quickly as the player progresses and the courses become repetitive.  The reviewer also points out that racing against human opponents is more satisfying than against the computer.

**Judgement:** The reviewer finds the game enjoyable for a short time, but ultimately lacking in variety and depth.  The reviewer states that the game's highly dangerous sprint-racing is addictive initially, but the lack of significant upgrades and the repetitive nature of the circuits make the game less engaging as the player progresses.

* **Vehicles:** Players can customize their vehicles with weapons (missiles, etc.) and upgrades (speed boosts, new tires, turbos).

The review is detailed and includes several sections:

**Graphics and Sound:** The reviewer praises the sound effects, describing them as ""gloriously"" lifting the game, and the ""growled 'Bye bye, Billy!'"" and ""chorus of evil laughter"" as realistic.  They also note the ""brilliant Gremlin sprites"" that ""actually look real"" and move in a ""mischievous"" way, which compensates for the ""functional scenery."" However, a ""flick-scroll system"" is criticized as irritating.

**Gameplay and Story:** The review describes the gameplay as challenging, with Gremlins being unpredictable and difficult to kill.  The need to collect parts of Gizmo's magic box to progress is highlighted as a significant gameplay element, but also a source of frustration due to the difficulty and clumsiness of the scrolling gameplay.  The reviewer notes the ""wild, wicked and witty"" Gremlins and their various attacks.

**Overall Judgement:** The reviewer gives a mixed assessment.  While praising the graphics and sound, they criticize the difficulty and frustration of the game, calling it ""massively more frustrating"" and ""a practical impossibility"" to collect all the parts of Gizmo's box.  The review concludes that the game is ""fun but too frustrating,"" especially due to the Gremlins' unpredictable behavior.

However, ""Wolfpack"" is praised for its strategy elements, which supplement the gameplay.  The reviewer notes that the game is not an in-depth investigation of WWII diesel engines, but the sub simulator is strong enough to justify the game and the strategy is a good secondary element.

It describes the various tactics, including attacking in wolfpacks, the role of sonar and radar, and the importance of anticipating the enemy's moves.

* **Introduction:** The review begins with a concise overview of the genlock's function and capabilities, emphasizing its ability to synchronize Amiga video output with a video recorder.  It also notes the genlock's dual functionality as both an input and output device.

* **Functionality and Features:** The review details the genlock's operation, including its ability to split signals for micro and video monitor output, and the use of ""direct"" and ""inverse"" control buttons for foreground/background masking.  It explains how the genlock allows for combining Amiga images with video signals from other sources.  The review also mentions the included Scart connections and phono sockets for various video and audio inputs/outputs.

* **Hardware Description:** The review describes the physical unit as a ""good, no-frills"" genlock with a simple design.  It notes the hardware's rock-steady superposition and instantaneous signal switching.  It also highlights the separate control knobs for luminance, contrast, color, and phase, as well as the ability to adjust individual Red, Green, and Blue components.

* **Comparison to Competition:** The review directly compares the GST Gold to other, potentially more up-to-date, genlock units.  It points out that the design is based on an older model, originally for the Atari ST, and questions whether the price is justified given the similar functionality of newer models.

* **Software Considerations:** The review emphasizes the importance of accompanying software for effective use of the genlock, particularly for video editing and titling.  It mentions a titling package (Title Page) and a paint package (Deluxe Video III) as examples.  It also notes the absence of a digitizer in the genlock unit, which is a feature found in some competing models at a similar price point.

* **Price and Value:** The review explicitly addresses the price of the genlock, noting that at £500, it's a significant investment.  It contrasts this price with the potential for similar functionality at a lower cost, suggesting that the build quality might be the only significant differentiator.

* **Additional Features:** The review mentions a slide fader for precise superimposition adjustment, a feature absent in the GST Gold, and its potential value in real-time mixing and fades.

* **Overall Impression:** The review concludes with a balanced assessment of the genlock, acknowledging its functionality and reliability but also highlighting the lack of certain features and the relatively high price compared to potential alternatives.

225,"This page is a review of the computer game ""Boomeraid,"" published in Amiga Format magazine in December 1990.

The review, written by Damien Noonan, highlights the game's use of complex mathematics in a very Australian way.  The game involves a hero using boomerangs to clear a crime-ridden park.

**Game Overview:**

The game, ""Boomeraid,"" is described as a game for children of the video age, similar in style to ""Light Force.""  The gameplay centers around throwing boomerangs, which are represented graphically on the screen.  The player must manipulate the graph to accurately plot the boomerang's flight path.  The game uses various mathematical concepts, including Cartesian coordinates, algebraic functions, and parabolas, to determine the boomerang's trajectory.  The difficulty increases as the player progresses, requiring more complex mathematical calculations to successfully throw the boomerang.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

The hero starts with spears, which have simple straight-line trajectories.  As the hero clears baddies, his ""Brainpower"" increases, allowing him to use more sophisticated boomerangs.  The game includes tutorials and tests (called ""Mathbench"") to help players learn the mathematical concepts needed to play.  Correct answers in the tests increase the hero's Brainpower and allow him to use more advanced boomerang types.  The game uses graphs to represent the boomerang's flight path, and the player must adjust equations to make the boomerang hit the target.  The game also includes a reward system, with progress through levels and successful tests rewarding the player with more powerful boomerangs.

**Review Rating and Conclusion:**

The review doesn't explicitly give a numerical rating, but it does offer a positive assessment of the game.  The reviewer notes that while ""Boomeraid"" is an earlier effort compared to ""Light Force"" by the same developers, it still offers a clever combination of game play and mathematical concepts.  The reviewer acknowledges some minor shortcomings, such as the presentation of the test exercises being slightly less clear, but overall, the game is praised for its enjoyable gameplay and its integration of mathematical principles.  The review concludes that the game is as much fun as algebra can be, appealing to young people who might not be as interested in textbooks.  The price is listed as £23.99 for all Amigas.

233,"This page is a review of the FrameGrabber V2.0 digitizing system, published in Amiga Format magazine, December 1990.  The review, written by Pat McDonald, is titled ""Freeze Frame.""

The review begins with a brief introduction and a ""confession"" from the reviewer, acknowledging that the software, while similar to previous versions, has been significantly updated.  The hardware, however, has limited availability.  The reviewer emphasizes that this is a real-time digitizer, allowing for the capture of moving video.

The ""How it Works"" section details the setup process.  It's not a plug-and-play device; the user needs a standard Amiga printer cable, a power source cable, a cable connecting the computer's video output to the FrameGrabber, a parallel port cable, and a cable from the FrameGrabber to the monitor.  The software requires at least 1MB of RAM, though 2MB is recommended for optimal performance.  The reviewer explains the process of capturing video, including the ability to switch between the video input and the Amiga display, and how to adjust the image's intensity and color saturation.  A brief delay is necessary for the software to download the captured image.

The ""Verdict"" section summarizes the reviewer's opinion.  The FrameGrabber is expensive but desirable, particularly for professional use.  The quality is impressive, and the system effectively solves the problems of capturing video information.  The reviewer highlights the system's ability to capture high-quality images.

The ""Movies Too"" section focuses on the animation capabilities of the software.  It highlights the ability to create and manipulate sequences of frames, adjust playback speed and looping, and import animations into Deluxe Paint III for retouching.  The review also discusses the various screen resolutions supported, including black and white options ranging from 320x200 to 640x400, and color options with varying resolutions and color depths.  The reviewer notes that higher resolutions require additional hardware.

A small image of the FrameGrabber, its manual, and a floppy disk are included.  The image also shows the Vicon VC285 camera, which was used to capture the images in the review.  The review also includes contact information for Marcam Ltd, the manufacturer of the FrameGrabber.

The overall review rating isn't explicitly stated as a numerical score, but the tone suggests a positive, though not unqualified, recommendation.  The reviewer acknowledges the high cost but emphasizes the system's professional-grade capabilities and high-quality image capture.

243,"This page is from a magazine, likely *Amiga Format*, and is a review/feature article about two music creation programs for the Amiga computer, Hyperchord and Pixound, both developed by Hologramophone.  The date is December 1990.

**Review of Hyperchord:**

The review, written by Maff Evans, gives a mixed assessment of Hyperchord.  The author highlights the interesting concept of creating music by drawing ""riffs"" on a grid, using different scales and chord progressions.  However, the review criticizes the program's output, stating that the music produced is not particularly melodic or sophisticated, comparing it to a cat playing a keyboard.  The author notes that the program requires a strong understanding of music theory to produce anything resembling a tune.  The review also points out that the program is expensive, and suggests that buying music from bands is a more cost-effective way to get good music.

**Review Rating (Implicit):**  The review is largely negative, though not explicitly stating a rating. The author's tone and comparisons suggest a low rating for the program's musical output.

**Review of Pixound:**

The review of Pixound is even more critical.  The author describes the program as a ""freak-out hippy program"" that produces music from fractal patterns and images.  The author finds the program's output to be uninspired and lacking in musical quality, comparing the sound to a psychopath playing a Stylophone.  The author notes that the program's potential is intriguing, but the actual music produced is not appealing.

**Review Rating (Implicit):**  The review is extremely negative, with the author expressing strong disapproval of the program's output.

**Page Layout and Content:**

The page includes screenshots and diagrams of both programs' interfaces.  The article is well-organized, with sections clearly labeled (e.g., ""The Colour of Sound,"" ""Project Setup"").  The page also includes information about the programs' pricing and availability, listing the software company and contact details.
