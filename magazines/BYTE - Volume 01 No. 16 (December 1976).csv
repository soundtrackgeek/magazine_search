**Figure 1:** This figure displays three possible bar code formats (labeled 1a, 1b, and 1c).  Each format is illustrated with diagrams showing the arrangement of dark and light bars to represent binary data (0s and 1s).  The diagrams clearly show the different widths and spacing of the bars in each format.

* **Figure 1a (Format 1):**  Bar width modulation.  Data is encoded by varying the width of the bars.  Alternating dark and light bars represent the data.  The widths of the ""TO"" and ""T1"" bars are the parameters to be specified for printing.  A trailing bit is required to complement the last data bit in a string.

* **Figure 1b (Format 2):** Ratio recording.  The parameters to be specified are the bit length (TB) and the widths of the ""TO"" and ""T1"" bars.  The time between transitions (light to dark or dark to light) is used to determine the bit value.  The length of the bit is independent of the data state.

* **Figure 1c (Format 3):** Fixed gap bar width modulation.  The parameters are the interbar gap width (TG) and the bit length parameters (TO and T1).  The length of the gap between bars is used to determine the bit value.  The data density varies depending on the number of 0s and 1s in a given region.

**Textual Description:** The text accompanying the figures explains the parameters that need to be defined for each format, how the data is read by a machine, and the advantages of each format.  It also discusses the potential use of these bar codes in publishing and other applications.  The text mentions that the formats are designed for use in machine-readable data, and that they are intended for use in magazines, journals, and other publications.  The text also discusses the need for error checking mechanisms in the bar code design.

"
21,"This page describes a software structure for a scan conversion system, likely for a barcode scanner.  The text details the design and function of three major program components: SCAN, BITPACKER, and FRAMER.

**SCAN Program:** This program acts as an interrupt handler (or a dedicated scanning loop).  Its primary function is to convert the light and dark periods sensed by the scanner's wand into a series of bytes containing timing counts.  These timing counts are stored in an INPUT BUFFER.  The algorithm for inputting a line of coded bars is described, emphasizing how the process can be optimized by filtering on the fly or in hardware to handle around 800 bytes.  The program's operation is detailed in a step-by-step process, including setting the buffer pointer and counter to zero, checking for interrupts, incrementing the counter, and handling input level changes.

**BITPACKER Program:** This program is invoked at the end of the SCAN program.  It transforms the input buffer into a ""frame buffer"" of bytes, adapting to speed and timing variations.  The description highlights the conversion process and its adaptation to speed variations.

**FRAMER Program:** This program is invoked after the BITPACKER program.  It further reduces the frame buffer image into an absolute binary image in memory.  It also checks for errors and sets up for rescans if necessary.  The text emphasizes the transformation of the frame buffer image and the error-checking process.

**Overall Software Structure:** The page presents a flowchart-like diagram illustrating the flow of data between these three programs.  Arrows show the data transfer between the INPUT BUFFER, FRAME BUFFER, and MEMORY.  The diagram also shows the paths for error messages and rescans.

**Additional Notes:** The text discusses the importance of replacing interrupts with ""do nothing"" states to ensure consistent timing.  It also describes a method for processing the buffer to extract data, including a technique for handling noise and dust specks.  The text also mentions the need for a line buffer to store input data before passing it to the loader.  A method for compensating for the scanner's perception of bar width is also described.

**Figure 1:** The figure provides a visual representation of the software structure, clarifying the relationships between the three programs and their interactions with memory and error handling.  The figure also highlights the option of combining BITPACKER and FRAMER into a single pass.

The first section, titled ""BITPACKER Program,"" details a procedure for converting input data from a buffer into a line buffer.  It's presented as a series of numbered steps, each outlining a specific action.  The steps involve checking conditions (e.g., if the end of the input buffer is reached), loading data, incrementing pointers, calculating values (like checksums), and making decisions based on the results of these calculations.  The algorithm appears to handle different types of data (bar counts, space counts, basic unit counts) and manage the conversion process step-by-step.

The second section, titled ""FRAMER Program,"" describes a different algorithm for loading line data into memory.  This algorithm focuses on processing the frame format of the input line, which includes sync characters, checksums, base addresses, and lengths.  It also involves incrementing pointers, loading data into specific locations, and checking for consistency between expected values and actual values.  This section also includes a note that the algorithms are simplified and that more sophisticated algorithms might be needed for more complex scenarios.

A section titled ""Bar Codes and Morse Codes"" precedes the algorithms. This section contains an author's comment on the article's content, highlighting the problem of decoding optical bar codes and its analogy to decoding Morse code.  It also mentions the simplicity and reliability of the described method, and that the local ratios of bar lengths are always ""perfect"" due to the type-setting and printing process.

26,"This page is a technical article, likely from a computer magazine or journal, discussing a low-cost approach to human interaction with color graphics.

The article, titled ""A Low Cost TV Approach to Human Interaction with Color Graphics,"" is by Thomas A. Dwyer and Leon Sweer of the Soloworks Lab at the University of Pittsburgh.

The article focuses on the Cromemco TV Dazzler, a peripheral device described in BYTE magazine (June 1976, page 6).  It highlights the Dazzler's ability to display computer graphics on a standard color TV set, making it a more accessible and affordable alternative to expensive color graphics systems.

The authors emphasize the simplicity of the Dazzler's output method, contrasting it with the complexities of other, more expensive systems.  They also point out the potential for educational and home computing applications, particularly if simple user-oriented graphic instructions become available in higher-level languages like BASIC.

A key concern is the lack of user-friendly input devices for interacting with color graphics.  The authors suggest that the future of computer graphics lies in making computers responsive to more intuitive, ""macro"" actions, mirroring human imagination and creativity.  They use the analogy of an airplane pilot to illustrate this point, contrasting passive observation with active control.

The article concludes by mentioning two obstacles to the Dazzler's full potential: difficulty in programming and the need for more user-friendly input devices.

The page also includes a small black and white image of a child interacting with a computer and a TV monitor, likely illustrating the concept of the article.  The image shows a child sitting in front of a computer and a TV monitor, suggesting the ease of use of the system.

The page number 24 is present at the bottom, indicating its position within a larger document."
27,"This page describes a ""Cybernetic Crayon System,"" a graphics software system designed for creating images on a computer screen.

**Figure 1: The Cybernetic Crayon System:**  The diagram shows a child interacting with a device, likely a digitizer, to draw on a color TV.  The XY digitizer's position controls the drawing, and the system uses this position data along with settings on the front panel to determine the color of each drawn point.  The diagram also shows the connections to a color TV, a memory unit, a ""crayon"" input device, and an ""erase"" switch.

**Graphics Software:** This section discusses the work of Dartmouth researchers, particularly Arthur Luehrmann, on extending the BASIC programming language to include graphics capabilities.  The authors note that while a good idea, it's a slow process to get different groups to agree on extensions.  They mention that they're exploring extending one of the microcomputer versions of BASIC to support graphics.  The authors also suggest a method of ""imagining"" a desired graphic function and then creating a language to instruct the computer to perform that function.  They propose using macro instructions, which could be hidden from the user, to simplify the process.  The idea of ""structured programming"" is also mentioned as a relevant concept.

**The Cybernetic Crayon Idea:** This section describes the concept behind the system.  The authors envision a system where a child can draw on a TV screen using an electronic ""crayon.""  They imagine a more advanced application, like a space-ship simulation game, where a user could navigate a spaceship through a galaxy.  The section outlines a hypothetical computer program that would handle the drawing process, including turning on the display, erasing the screen, determining the crayon's position and color, decoding the information, and putting the information into the computer's memory for display.  The authors highlight the ""hardest"" parts of the program as steps 2, 3, 5, and 6.

**Using an XY Digitizer as the Crayon:** This section discusses the different options for the ""crayon"" device, including a light pen and a two-axis joystick.

Overall, the page presents a conceptual design for a graphics system, emphasizing the use of a digitizer and a high-level language to simplify the process of creating images.  It also touches on the broader topic of graphics software development and the challenges of integrating different functionalities.
"
28,"This page describes how a ""Cybernetic Crayon's Surplus Digitizer"" works, focusing on its use of Gray code.

The text explains that the digitizer is a mechanical device similar to a plotter, but in reverse.  A user moves a ""crayon"" (a pointer), which moves contacts to record X and Y coordinates.  These contacts are connected to brushes that slide across metal templates.  The output for each coordinate is a 7-bit binary number, allowing for 128 possible values.  Each output is connected to an 8-bit parallel input port of a microcomputer.

Crucially, the digitizer uses Gray code instead of standard binary code to represent the X and Y positions.  The explanation details why Gray code is preferred:  in standard binary, multiple bits change when moving from one number to the next, which can cause errors in a low-cost mechanical device.  Gray code ensures that only one bit changes at a time, preventing these errors.

The page includes a table (Figure 2) showing the Gray code, its corresponding binary code, and the decimal equivalent for values 0 through 20.  This table demonstrates how the Gray code translates to standard binary.

The text also provides an algorithm for translating Gray coded numbers back into standard binary, which is necessary for the computer to interpret the data.

Finally, the page includes a diagram (Figure 2) of the digitizer's mechanical components, illustrating the brushes and templates.  The diagram also shows how the rough artwork of an image can be drawn on paper, or the image can be created without such a layout. The Gray code pattern of the inputs can be seen in diagram form and equivalent binary form at the right.

The page's focus is on the technical details of the digitizer's operation, particularly its use of Gray code to avoid errors in data transmission.

The text is heavily focused on assembly language instructions (e.g., MOV, ADD, SUB, RLC, etc.) and hexadecimal values.  It describes a series of steps to translate X and Y coordinates into a memory address.  The process involves:

* **Quadrant Determination:** Checking if X and/or Y coordinates are greater than or equal to 64 to determine the quadrant of the screen.  Adding offsets (512 or 1024) to the starting address based on the quadrant.
* **Coordinate Normalization:** Subtracting 64 from X or Y if they are greater than 64, effectively normalizing the coordinates to the range 0-63 for each axis.
* **Displacement Calculation:**  Multiplying Y by 8, masking out lower bits of X, dividing X by 4, and adding the results to the address calculated from Y.  These steps appear to be crucial for converting the normalized coordinates into the correct memory offset.
* **Memory Address Calculation:**  The final step combines the calculated displacement with the initial starting memory location to determine the precise memory address.

**Example:** The example provided shows how the process works with X=47 and Y=71, starting at memory location 4096.  The calculation results in a final memory address of 5195.

The page is focused on the ""Stretch That 6800 Clock"" topic, and it details the timing diagrams and considerations for interfacing a 6800 system with memory devices that have slower access times than the processor's clock speed.

**Sections and Content:**

* **Introduction (Text):**  A paragraph by Jerry Henshaw, describing his project of building a Southwest Technical Products (SWTPC) M6800 computer system with a slow memory interface. He explains the need for this interface due to the 895 kHz clock rate of the system requiring memory access times of approximately 700 ns or less, while the M6800 running at full speed (1 MHz) requires memory access times of 575 ns or less.  He also mentions using electrically erasable read-only memories (EPROMs) for an operating system, which have slower access times.

* **Two Approaches to Slow Memory:** The text outlines two approaches to handling slow memory devices:
    * **Slowing the System Clock:** This approach involves reducing the system clock speed to match the slowest memory device, which is undesirable because it slows down the entire system.
    * **Asynchronous Communication:** This approach involves slowing the clock only when the processor is communicating with a slow memory device, allowing the processor to run at full speed when communicating with faster memory. This is the approach the author chose.

* **Timing Diagrams (Figures 1a and 1b):** These figures are crucial for understanding the timing relationships between various signals in the M6800 processor during memory read and write cycles.
    * **Figure 1a (Read Cycle):** Shows the timing diagram for a nominal memory or peripheral read cycle.  It details the various signal transitions (e.g., VCC, TASR, TASC, TVSC, TDSU) and their durations.
    * **Figure 1b (Write Cycle):** Shows the timing diagram for a nominal memory or peripheral write cycle, illustrating the timing relationships for writing data to memory locations.

* **Explanation of Timing Diagrams:** The text accompanying the figures explains the timing requirements for the M6800 processor to interact with memory.  It highlights the importance of signal timing (e.g., TACC, which is 575 ns for a 1 MHz clock) and how these timings relate to the system's clock speed.

* **Source:** The text clearly indicates that the timing diagrams are reproduced from page 4-51 of the M6800 Microprocessor Applications Manual, courtesy of Motorola Semiconductor Products Inc.

* **Page Number:** The page number (42) is present at the bottom of the page.


**Overall:** The page provides a detailed technical explanation of the timing considerations for interfacing a slow memory system with a Motorola 6800 processor.  It's a valuable resource for someone working on a similar project.
"
45,"This page contains technical diagrams and descriptions related to the timing of memory operations in a microprocessor, specifically the Motorola M6800.

The page features two main figures (2a and 2b) illustrating the nominal memory read and write cycles, respectively.  These cycles are ""stretched"" by holding the Φ2 signal to accommodate slower memory circuits.  The diagrams show the timing waveforms for various signals like VCC, R/W, Address, VMA, Data, and Φ1 and Φ2 (clock signals).  Voltage levels (e.g., 0.3V, 0.8V, 2.0V, 2.4V) and time durations (e.g., TASR, TASC, TVSC, TACC, TDSU, TEH, tcyc) are clearly labeled on the diagrams, indicating specific timing requirements for the memory operations.  The diagrams also include annotations like ""Data Not Valid"" to highlight critical periods in the cycle.

There's also a photo (Photo 1) that's an oscilloscope trace showing the slow memory interface timing.  This trace visually demonstrates the timing relationships between the Φ1 and Φ2 signals and the slow memory line.  The author's circuit is referenced in the caption.

The text accompanying the figures explains the operation of the memory access process.  It describes how the processor raises the read/write line, places an address on the bus, and activates the valid memory address line.  The text details the duration of these operations (e.g., approximately 500 ns for a 1 MHz system) and the timing requirements for data stability.  The access time of the M6800 is also discussed.

The figures and text are part of a larger document, likely a technical manual or application note, as indicated by the reference to page numbers (4-52 and 4-53) and the mention of the ""M6800 Microprocessor Applications Manual.""

The left diagram depicts a simpler head, while the right shows a more complex design incorporating a sapphire ball as a rolling contact point.  Both diagrams show light from an infrared source traveling through fiber optic bundles to a photodetector.  The text accompanying the diagrams explains that the light passes through lenses, reflects off the coded bar pattern on the paper, and is then detected.  The diagrams also highlight the potential issue of specular reflection problems due to the vertical incidence of light.

**Optical Systems Section:**  This section describes two primary optical techniques for projecting the coded bar pattern onto the photodetector.  The first, and more common, method uses fiber optic bundles.  The text explains how light from a source (infrared or red LED, or incandescent bulb) is focused onto one bundle, travels through the bundle to the coded bar pattern, reflects back, and then travels through a second bundle to the photodetector.  The two bundles are merged into a Y-shaped assembly, and the light is focused through a lens.

**Technical Description:** The article's text explains the need to convert variable-width bar codes into logic level signals for serial data entry, and then into parallel, byte-organized data.  It also outlines the pattern recognition techniques necessary for this conversion.  The article further details the hardware aspects of bar code scanning, including optical systems, detector characteristics, and signal conditioning.  The article states that the software aspects are covered in another article in the same issue.

"
108,"This page contains technical specifications and instructions for an audio cassette interface, likely for a computer system.  It details how to use the interface in both incremental (start-stop) and continuous modes.

**Incremental Mode:**

The document emphasizes the importance of setting a time delay (using resistor R39) to allow the cassette recorder's motors to reach speed before recording.  It also highlights the need for a software delay loop in the program, at least as long as the hardware timer delay plus 0.5 seconds.  This is crucial to prevent errors during data transfer, particularly when the carrier signal on the tape is lost.  The text explains that a header character or characters are recommended to mark the beginning of each recorded segment.  The interface is more susceptible to errors when reading data between recorded segments.  The instructions also mention a control character or block data count in the header to help the system identify the end of data blocks.  The document also describes how to use the interface with a specific computer system (SWTPC 6800 and CT-1024 terminal) and how to use the ASCII control T command to turn the recorder off and mark the end of a data record.

**Continuous Mode:**

The instructions for continuous mode are simpler, stating that the interface operation is similar to paper tape operation, requiring manual start and stop of the recorder.  No special recording considerations are needed.

**Data Transfer and Dumping:**

The document details how to use the interface to dump data from a computer's memory to a cassette tape using the Motorola MIKBUG firmware.  It specifies memory locations (A048 and A049) and the need to set the starting and ending addresses of the memory segment to be dumped (A002 through A005).  The instructions also explain how to use the record/read status switches and the local/remote switch on the interface.  The process involves using the rewind and play buttons on the cassette recorder, entering a ""P"" command on the terminal, and observing the status and data lights to confirm the dump process.

**Error Handling and Timing:**

The document addresses potential errors, particularly the slight delay between the loss of carrier on the tape and the action of the carrier detect circuitry.  This delay can cause gaps in the 16 X UART clock, which is why a software delay is necessary.  The text emphasizes that this consideration is only relevant when using the interface in incremental mode.

116,"This page contains a technical description of a Universal Turing Machine (UTM).  It's part of a larger document, as indicated by page numbers 114.

The text discusses the UTM, explaining why it's a useful model despite its seeming simplicity.  It highlights that the UTM is the easiest to implement, even though a machine with more symbols (like 256) might be more practical for some applications.  The key point is that the memory is bit-addressable, which simplifies the design.

The author emphasizes that a UTM is essentially a program in a simple language that can execute any other Turing machine program.  It takes two inputs: the program of the other Turing machine and the data for that program.

The page details the format of the single instruction used in the UTM language.  This instruction combines several functions: writing a bit value (w) to the current memory location, moving the ""head"" left or right (d), and branching to a different instruction based on the value of the current memory location (a).

The text also explains the concept of a ""tape"" as the memory, and how it's accessed sequentially.  It describes how the machine has an index register (head) that moves through the tape.

A diagram (Figure 1) is referenced, showing a one-state Turing machine program.  This program is used to illustrate how a simple task (clearing the tape) can be accomplished.

The page concludes with a discussion of Church's Thesis, which states that Turing machines can perform any computable function.  The author notes that this thesis is difficult to prove rigorously but has stood the test of time.  The overall tone is technical and informative, aimed at a reader with a background in computer science or related fields.

130,"This page is an article from a technical forum, specifically a proposal for a universal prototyping bus structure.  The author, David Washburn, outlines his reasoning for a universal bus design.

The article begins with an introduction, stating that BYTE magazine receives letters on technical points that warrant special treatment.  The Technical Forum section is dedicated to such discussions.  This particular submission proposes a universal bus structure for prototyping.

The proposal is detailed, with the author explaining his motivation.  He initially wanted a universal bus but realized there are two distinct types of computer enthusiasts: those who want a readily usable system for BASIC programming and applications, and those who are more interested in high-performance systems hacking.

The author argues that existing systems, like Altairs and IMSAI, while useful for the first type of user, have limitations in terms of expansion and compatibility with future processors.  He points out the cost and difficulty of adapting to new processors with existing systems.

He argues that a universal bus could be designed to be compatible with a wide range of processors while maintaining independence from specific processor designs.  The author emphasizes the cost-effectiveness of a universal bus, as it would allow users to add memory to an existing system more cheaply than buying a whole new system.

The author also discusses the similarities between different processors, highlighting that they all need to address memory, send and receive data, and communicate with the outside world.  He suggests that if the differences between processors can be handled on the processor card itself, then the same memory and I/O cards can be shared by most processors.

The article concludes with the author's proposal for a universal bus system, aimed at users who want to experiment with different processors and create special cards for peripherals.  The overall tone is technical and focused on the practical aspects of computer hardware design.  There's no explicit review rating, but the article presents a detailed proposal for a new design.
