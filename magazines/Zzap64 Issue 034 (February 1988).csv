* **Rules (74%):**  The rules are comprehensive, but the lack of a contents page and index makes it difficult to find information.
* **Playability (71%):**  The review notes that the slow real-time gameplay and lack of tangible excitement are drawbacks.
* **Overall (72%):**  The overall rating is a moderate 72%, indicating a game that is slightly ambitious but worth trying.
