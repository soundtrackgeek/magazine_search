88,"This is an article from 80 PC Gamer, April 1999, reviewing Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings.

The article opens with a quote from Harter Ryan, Age of Kings producer, expressing the desire to add features requested by veteran players, but also to design the game so that players don't need to use all of them to win.

The article then details several improvements to the game's graphics, gameplay, and economic systems.  The terrain graphics are described as significantly enhanced, with improved water effects.  The command system is streamlined, allowing for automatic unit movement and production queuing.  Buildings are now transparent, revealing units behind them, and the proportions of structures have been adjusted.  The landscapes now feature male and female inhabitants, a cosmetic change but one that adds to the atmosphere.  The economic system is also improved, with a more sophisticated trade system allowing for buying and selling commodities and resources based on supply and demand.  This allows for more complex economic strategies.

The article highlights the AI improvements, noting that the AI now behaves more shrewdly and ruthlessly.  A scripting system allows for more complex reactions to player actions, including trading, building decisions, and surrender.  The article also mentions that players can create their own AI using the game's scripting system.

The article also discusses the detailed graphics, starting with sketch art and progressing to 3D models, which are then converted to 2D models with 3D functionality.  This allows players to see units moving through buildings.

Finally, the article mentions that each of the four civilizations (Western European, Eastern European, Mideastern, and Asian) has the ability to build its own unique Wonder, a special building.  The Western European Wonder is specifically mentioned and illustrated.

The overall tone of the review is positive, highlighting the improvements and new features of the game.  The review rating is not explicitly stated, but the detailed description of the improvements suggests a positive assessment of the game.

The top section is a guide to the seven factions in the game: Gaia's Stepdaughters, Human Hive, University of Planet, Morgan Industries, Spartan Federation, The Lord's Believers, and Peacekeeping Forces.  Each faction has a brief description of its leader and agenda.  For example, the Gaia's Stepdaughters are led by Lady Diedre Skye and have a Green Democracy agenda, focused on environmentalism.

Finally, the review concludes with a ""Final Verdict"" section, giving the game a 98% rating.

The review then dives into a detailed critique of the game's gameplay and design.

The reviewer states that the game doesn't live up to its promise.

The review highlights several key issues:

* **Poor Interface and Manual:** The reviewer criticizes the game's interface as ""prodigiously awkward"" and the manual as ""poor,"" making it difficult to understand how to play.  This is a significant problem, as the reviewer notes that experimentation often leads to frustration.

The review concludes with a final verdict, summarizing the game's shortcomings and recommending against purchasing it.  The reviewer highlights the game's poor documentation, frustrating interface, and lack of depth as major reasons for the low score.

115,"This page is a review of the video game ""CyberStrike 2,"" published in PC Gamer magazine in April 1999.

The review is presented in a standard magazine format, with a large headline ""CyberStrike 2"" at the top.  The review includes a summary of the game's key features, developer, publisher, and system requirements.  The review also includes a rating of 60%.

**Review Details:**

The review begins with a summary of the game's features, including the multi-player options and the subscription service.  The reviewer immediately raises the question of why one should pay for a game that can be played for free.  The reviewer argues that the single-player component is exceptionally frustrating due to poor AI and confusing missions.  The reviewer also notes that the terrain graphics are decent, but the lighting and explosion effects are exceptional.

The review then delves into the game's single-player and multi-player modes.  The single-player mode is criticized for its poor AI, which leads to missions that are confusing and frustrating.  The reviewer notes that the single-player mode has about two dozen missions against computer-controlled enemies, but the robots move aimlessly, get stuck in corners, and shoot their own men.  The reviewer also points out that the control scheme is problematic, requiring a joystick or keyboard, with no control configuration options.  The keyboard map is described as arcane and poorly planned.  The reviewer also notes that the ability to group wingmen is missing, making the task of giving orders cumbersome.

The multi-player mode is praised for its decent terrain graphics, lighting effects, and overall gameplay.  However, the reviewer points out that not all weapons are available in the free multi-player mode, and the full multi-player experience requires a monthly subscription fee.  The reviewer concludes that the only reason to buy the retail version of the game is for the single-player missions, but that the single-player mode is not worth the purchase price.

**Final Verdict:**

The review concludes with a ""Final Verdict"" section, giving the game a 60% rating.  The ""Highs"" section highlights the good multi-player gaming, decent terrain graphics, and lighting effects.  The ""Lows"" section emphasizes the poor single-player game, bad AI, and confusing missions.  The ""Bottom Line"" section summarizes the review, stating that the only reason to play the game is for its multi-player action, and that the multi-player mode can be accessed for free from the game's website.  The reviewer advises readers to skip the retail version and try the free multi-player mode instead.

**Additional Information:**

The page also includes a graphic representation of the game's final verdict, a 60% rating.

The review also mentions supported sound cards and multiplayer options (IPX, TCP/IP, Modem).

**Review Content:**

The review opens with a question: ""Do we really need another post-apocalyptic racing game?""  The reviewer then argues that while the plot is generic, the gameplay is unique.  The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where speed gangs race across the remains of a ravaged Earth.  The game starts with a limited number of tracks, which must be unlocked through the championship mode.  Players choose a vehicle, customize it with a character and paint scheme, and then race.

The review highlights the game's emphasis on the racing technique of slamming on the brakes, twisting the wheel, and allowing momentum to fish-tail the car through sharp turns.  This is described as being executed well, but the review notes that the game's control is overly slippery, with approximately 30% of the gameplay involving uncontrollable lateral sliding around corners.

**Graphics and Gameplay:**

The review praises the game's graphics, describing them as top-notch on a Pentium 233 or faster system.  The art direction is consistent, and the cars are smoothly modeled and realistic.  The game features exaggerated physics, resulting in a lot of airborne rolls, spins, and jumps.  The review mentions the use of a first-person perspective for a more intense experience.  The game includes half-pipes, ramps, and tubes for more challenging gameplay.  The review also notes the presence of secret tracks and areas to explore.

**Review Conclusion:**

The review concludes with a final verdict of 78%.  The reviewer acknowledges the game's strengths, including smooth visuals, immense racing worlds, and off-the-wall physics.  However, the reviewer criticizes the game's overly slippery controls and the fact that some tracks are not engaging.  The review's bottom line is that if the player enjoys eye-candy and exciting racing, ""Powerslide"" is a good choice.  The review is signed by Colin Williamson.

    * **Ineffective Clamps:** The wheel's clamping system is described as the ""flimsiest"" and prone to coming loose during use.
    * **Unnecessary Features:** The review questions the purpose of the on/off rocker switch and the limited rubber coating on the wheel's grip.
* **Overall:** The review concludes that the wheel's design flaws and poor performance make it a poor value compared to other options.


**2. Gallant AudioStorm MT7F/X Speakers:**

* **Rating:** The review is mixed, with a final verdict that there are much better home theater setups available.
* **Description:** The review focuses on the speakers' sound quality and design:
    * **Sound Quality:** The satellites are described as ""tinny"" and lacking midrange, even at maximum volume. The subwoofer is underpowered and poorly designed, with the volume control knob integrated into the subwoofer housing, making it difficult to place. The center channel speaker is also housed within the subwoofer, limiting placement options.
    * **Design:** The flat-panel design is noted, but the overall performance does not match the price range. The wire connecting the decoder to the subwoofer is a significant design flaw.
