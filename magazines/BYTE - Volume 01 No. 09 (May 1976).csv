Bits 0-4 of the MAR identify the current page, and bits 5-11 identify the location within the page.

**Memory Reference Instructions:** The page explains how memory reference instructions operate.  The first three bits of the instruction specify the operation code (opcode), and the remaining bits specify the operand address.  The page address (bits 5-11) identifies the location of the operand within the page, but not the page itself.  The page bit (bit 4) determines whether the operand is on page 0 or the current page.  Examples are given to illustrate how the page bit and page address work together to determine the full 12-bit address.

**Operate Instructions:** The page briefly mentions a second category of instructions called ""operate instructions,"" which all have an opcode of octal 7.  These instructions are used for internal operations like conditional and unconditional skips, accumulator rotations, and clearing/setting the accumulator.

**Memory Reference Instruction Format (Figure 3):**  A diagram (Figure 3) illustrates the format of memory reference instructions.

It emphasizes that while microprocessors are inherently digital, they can process analog signals with minimal additional hardware.  The article also touches on the cost-effectiveness of microprocessor-based analog conversion compared to traditional methods.

**Section 2: The Ramp Technique**

This section details the ramp technique for analog-to-digital conversion.  It describes the technique as the simplest approach, needing the least code in the microprocessor, but also the slowest, approximately 15 times slower than the successive approximation method.  The text explains the concept and provides a block diagram (Figure 1) of the AD conversion system.  It emphasizes that the same hardware components can be used for different conversion algorithms (ramp, successive approximation, etc.) by tailoring the software.  The section explains how the circuit works, assuming a specific analog input voltage, and how the microprocessor increments the digital word applied to the DAC until the output voltage matches the input voltage.  The process is described in detail, including the role of the comparator and the DAC.  Crucially, it explains how the microprocessor reads the comparator's output to determine if the digital word is too large or too small, incrementing the word accordingly until the correct digital representation of the analog input is found.  The article also mentions that each step in the ramp process is 1/256th of the total range.

**Section 3: Analog-to-Digital Conversion Techniques**

The article briefly discusses two techniques for analog-to-digital conversion: the ramp technique and successive approximation.

The listings show the assembly language instructions for the program.  The ramp method is described as starting at zero and incrementing the output voltage, testing the comparator, and repeating until the conversion is complete.

**Figures and Listings:**

* **Figure 1:** A diagram illustrating the microprocessor-controlled analog-digital conversion system.  It shows the connection between the microprocessor, the DAC, the comparator, and the analog input.

* **Listing 1:** Assembly language code for the Motorola 6800 microprocessor, implementing the ramp method.

* **Listing 2:** Assembly language code for the Intel 8008 microprocessor, implementing the ramp method.

**Key Concepts:**
