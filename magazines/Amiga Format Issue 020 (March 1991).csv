105,"This page is an article from a magazine called ""Football Crazy,"" likely from March 1991, focusing on a review or analysis of a football video game, likely for the Amiga computer.  The article is titled ""It's a Funny Old Game.""

The article is a technical analysis of the game, specifically discussing the game's ""exotic"" players and how they behave differently than typical players.  The author, Ewart Jones, delves into the game's programming, revealing how the game's developers used trigonometric acceleration probability algorithms to control these unusual players.

The article highlights specific player behaviors, such as:

* **Chris Woggle F:**  Only found within 10 yards of the sideline, joystick direction to cut inside causes 1/4 speed. If crosses into penalty area, all teammates relocate within ten yards of the halfway line.
* **Ron McButterflinger Goalie:**  Runs towards the corner flag as soon as the ball is in sight, making spectacular dives.
* **Harry Hoofer:**  The famous Slough Academicals left back, who unfortunately could never make a tackle without kicking the ball into touch.
* **Sid Crashtackle D:**  Always slides into tackles and goes 20 yards past. Always connects with the ball but never comes out of the tackle.

The author also discusses the game's history, mentioning Blokins' World Soccer '80 as a precursor to the modern football simulation games.  The article notes that the game's movement and animation were innovative for its time.

The article is well-structured, with clear headings and subheadings, making it easy to follow the author's points.  The page also includes illustrations of the game's characters and the playing field, which help to visualize the author's descriptions.

The descriptions often include statistics or probabilities, such as ""69% sulks on sidelines,"" ""1% chance scores magnificent goal,"" or ""40% chance of penalty.""  These numbers likely represent the player's performance in the game, adding a quantitative element to the qualitative descriptions.

The review, written by Maff Evans, details the updated version of the Action Replay, a device designed to allow users to manipulate and extract data from programs.

The cartridge is described as having a solid top-mounted freeze button and a variable ""slow-motion"" device.

* **Monitor:**  This section is geared towards more advanced users, allowing them to read and modify program code.  Users can alter program data and save the changes for later use.

* **Sound:** The review notes a significant improvement over the previous version.  The new version allows users to capture and save sound samples from running programs, using a single waveform display to locate and select the desired sample.

* **Graphics:** This section highlights the powerful screen capture capabilities.  Users can grab screens from demos, games, or even slide shows, and manipulate them using a powerful editor.  The editor allows for resizing, dual playfields, HAM screens, and color adjustments.

129,"This page is a review of the DG40 Automatic RGB Splitter, published in *Amiga Format* magazine in March 1991.  The review is spread across several paragraphs and sections, providing a detailed look at the product's features, performance, and value.

**Product Description:**

The DG40 is a black box automatic RGB splitter designed for use with video digitizers.  It's described as a ""standard black box"" with fairly standard electronics inside to filter red, green, and blue components of a video signal.  It has inputs for composite (PAL) video and S-VHS (Super VHS), a connector commonly used by color cameras.  A joystick port is included for switching between colors.  The unit includes a power supply.  Controls for adjusting video signal contrast, brightness, and color saturation are located on the front panel.  A phono connector is also present for connection to a VidiAmiga.

**Review Sections:**

* **Testbench:** This section details the reviewer's experience with the DG40.  The reviewer notes that while the product comes with an English manual, it's somewhat lacking in detail, particularly regarding compatibility with various digitizers and technical specifications.  The reviewer also compares the DG40 to the VidiRGB splitter, highlighting the DG40's slightly less flexible input options (S-VHS and PAL) compared to the VidiRGB's wider input range.  The reviewer also mentions that the DG40 requires patience when used with DigiView, as the joystick port connection needs a small metallic object (like a paperclip) to work properly.  A significant drawback is that the DG40 doesn't provide visual feedback on the current color being displayed, making it difficult to adjust the image.

* **Results:** The reviewer finds the DG40's image quality superior to that of the VidiRGB.  They attribute this to the DG40's metal casing, which reduces radio noise and degrades video signals.  The reviewer notes that the DG40 is easier to use than the VidiRGB, due to its size and placement of controls.

* **Quality of Digitized Images:** The reviewer praises the quality of the digitized images produced by the DG40, describing them as sharp and distinct.  The images are compared to those grabbed from a television using a color camera, highlighting the DG40's ability to capture high-quality images.

* **Verdict:** This section summarizes the review's findings in a table format.  The reviewer gives the DG40 an ""Excellent"" rating for speed, a ""Poor"" rating for documentation, and an ""Average"" rating for value and features.  The reviewer notes the DG40's limited features, such as its inability to directly input RGB signals.  Despite these limitations, the DG40 is praised for its sharp picture quality.

**Overall:**

The review presents a balanced assessment of the DG40.  While the documentation is lacking and the lack of RGB input is a limitation, the DG40's image quality and ease of use are highlighted as strengths.  The review is helpful for potential buyers considering the DG40, but it also emphasizes the importance of understanding the product's limitations and compatibility with other equipment.

167,"This page is a review of the Kawai FunLab Complete Music System, published in *Amiga Format* magazine in March 1991.  The reviewer, Jon Bates, provides a detailed overview of the system's features and functionality.

**Review Rating:**  While the review doesn't explicitly assign a star rating, the overall tone suggests a mixed opinion.  The reviewer highlights both strengths and weaknesses of the software and hardware.

**Product Description:** The FunLab is a complete music system, including software, a keyboard, and interface components, designed for Amiga computers.  It's marketed as a beginner-friendly option for creating music.  The system is priced at £329.

**Review Sections:**

* **Introduction:** The review begins by noting the FunLab's significance as the first dedicated synthesizer/keyboard software specifically designed for the Amiga, resulting from a collaboration between Steinberg (the software company) and Kawai (the hardware manufacturer).  The reviewer emphasizes the system's target audience: beginners.

* **Software Overview:**  The review details the software's functionality.  It's a five-channel tone module with designated parts (Melody 1, Melody 2, Chord, Bass, Drums).  The software includes a main sequencing page with controls for each part, including overdub, mute, quantize, and volume.  It also features simple tape recorder-style controls, loop functions, and tempo controls.  A piano keyboard visually displays the notes being played.

* **Sound Creation:** The keyboard has 100 preset sounds, plus the ability to create custom sounds within the software.  These sounds can be assigned to any part except drums.  The review mentions the inclusion of various built-in rhythms and accompaniments.

* **Karaoke/Lyrics:** The software allows for lyrics to scroll along with the music, making it suitable for karaoke-style use.

* **Notation:** The software allows for traditional musical notation display, but editing within the notation view is limited.

* **Recording and Editing:** The review describes the recording process, highlighting the metronome and the ability to overdub.  However, it also points out significant limitations in editing capabilities, such as the inability to copy and paste sections or delete overdubbed parts.  The reviewer notes that long recordings can become tedious due to the lack of advanced editing tools.

* **Technical Specifications:** The review mentions the keyboard's specifications, including the number of keys (61), and that it's not touch-sensitive.  It also notes the software's file size.

* **Overall Assessment:** The review concludes with a critical evaluation of the FunLab's strengths and weaknesses.  While praising the system's ease of use for beginners and the inclusion of various sounds and rhythms, the reviewer criticizes the limited editing capabilities, particularly the lack of advanced features for editing and arranging recordings.  The review highlights the tedious nature of editing longer recordings due to the lack of advanced features.


**Additional Notes:** The page includes screenshots of the software interface and keyboard, illustrating the various controls and functions.  The review also mentions alternative ways to use the keyboard, such as using various effects (sustain, chorus, dual voice) either from the software or the front panel.  Finally, the review provides the model number and suggested retail price for the keyboard.
"
168,"This page is a review of the Kawai FunLab System, a music software package for the Kawai MS 710 keyboard.  The review, which appears to be from a magazine article, is spread across several paragraphs and sections.

**Review Rating:** The overall review rating is mixed, with a verdict that is ""average"" in terms of value and features, but ""good"" in terms of purpose, speed, documentation, and accessibility.

**Sections and Details:**

* **Add Weird Effects:** This section critiques the software's pitchbend function, which is limited to one tone up or down, and its awkward placement on the keyboard.  It also notes the on-screen volume faders and the ability to store balance settings between left and right stereo channels, but the inability to alter sounds during playback is a drawback.  The ability to add ""one-finger ad-lib"" accompaniment fills is highlighted as a positive.

* **Below Right: Registration:** This section describes the software's ability to save personalized keyboard settings, allowing up to five different configurations to be stored.

* **Below: Sounds:** This section discusses the software's ability to transform the keyboard into a synthesizer, allowing users to create original sounds by manipulating sound graphs.

* **Bottom: Jukebox:** This section describes the software's song selection feature, allowing users to select and play pre-loaded songs.

* **Top of the Pops?:** This section is the core of the review.  The reviewer praises the software's ease of use for beginners, calling it ""reasonably foolproof."" However, they criticize the software's rigid sequencing approach, lack of editing features (copy, cut, paste), and limited ability to expand or upgrade.  The reviewer also notes the software's focus on the Kawai keyboard, which limits its compatibility with other MIDI equipment.  The reviewer also points out the software's limitations in terms of recording and editing, and the lack of step-by-step guides in the manual.

* **More on Sounds:** This section details the software's ability to store up to 20 tone combinations, and its special features like ""dual"" (which stacks two voices and allows detuning), and the storage of performance data (tempo, balance, overall volume).  The reviewer notes that this data is separate from the sequencer data.

* **Write the Words:** This section describes the software's karaoke feature, allowing users to enter lyrics for their tunes.  The reviewer notes a minor inaccuracy in the manual's instructions regarding the process of entering lyrics.

* **Verdict:** This section summarizes the review's overall assessment.  The reviewer gives a detailed breakdown of the software's purpose, speed, documentation, accessibility, value, and features.  The reviewer concludes that while the software is a decent introduction for beginners, its limitations in terms of editing, expansion, and upgrading make it less appealing for more advanced users.

* **Technical Specifications:** The page includes screenshots and diagrams of the software's interface, showing various elements like the registration page, the sound editor, and the Jukebox.

The review is written in a detailed and critical manner, providing both positive and negative aspects of the software.  The reviewer's overall impression is that while the software is functional, it lacks the flexibility and features of more advanced music software packages.
