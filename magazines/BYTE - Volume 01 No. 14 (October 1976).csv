11,"This page contains an editorial by Carl Helmers titled ""The Concertina System.""  The editorial argues for the potential of personal computers to be used for musical applications, specifically comparing the concept to the adoption of automobiles.

The author begins by addressing the common skepticism surrounding the use of personal computers.  He poses the question ""What on earth do people do with home computers?"" and draws an analogy to the similar skepticism surrounding automobiles in the early 20th century.  He asserts that, just as the history of automobiles has demonstrated numerous practical uses, the coming decades will show similar practical applications for computers.

The author then argues that computing, without a specific purpose, is akin to driving without a destination.  He emphasizes the importance of ""applications"" for computers, just as a destination is important for a car trip.  He uses the example of customizing a computer system for playing music as an application, highlighting the potential for computers to be used as musical instruments.

The editorial then describes the traditional concertina as a simple pneumatic instrument similar to an accordion.  It notes the instrument's relative obscurity and its ability to produce a rich timbre.  The author then proposes the ""concertina system,"" a musical instrument based on a personal computer system integrated with musical software and peripherals.  He emphasizes that the concept of a digitally controlled musical instrument isn't new, but the technology to make it affordable and accessible is.

The author concludes by stating that for a similar price to a home organ, a computer system can be equipped with a music-playing peripheral that allows for musical performance feats not possible with traditional instruments.  He mentions two companies working on products that can convert existing computers into polyphonic synthesizers, including one company developing an Altair-compatible plug-in card with multiple channels of digitally controlled music output.  Another company, ALF Products, is in the pre-production stage of a modular computer-controlled synthesizer.

14,"This page contains a technical article, likely from a vintage electronics or ham radio publication, discussing the feasibility of using a computer to translate Morse code.

The article is titled ""The Computer... Versus... Hand Sent Morse Code.""  It's a technical discussion, not a review in the traditional sense.  There's no rating.

The article begins with an introduction that acknowledges the appeal of using computers for Morse code translation but cautions that perfect translation is unlikely.  It emphasizes that human operators often outperform computers in this task.

The core of the article is a diagram (Figure 1) of a suggested circuit using a NE567 PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) integrated circuit to decode the audio output of an amateur radio receiver.  The circuit is designed to convert the audio tones representing dots and dashes into digital signals (1s and 0s).  The text explains the function of each component and how the circuit works.  It also notes that noise and other signals from nearby stations can interfere with the receiver's output, making the translation process more complex.

The article then moves on to discuss the characteristics of hand-sent Morse code, explaining the relative durations of dots, dashes, and spaces.  It concludes by stating that translating machine-sent Morse code is relatively straightforward compared to hand-sent code because the timing intervals are consistent.  The article's overall tone is practical and informative, providing technical details and insights into the challenges of computer-based Morse code translation.

The page also includes a small header with the author's name, affiliation (Lt William A Hickey USN), and contact information.
"
15,"This page contains text describing a method for translating hand-sent Morse code.  It's likely an excerpt from a technical document or article.

The text discusses the challenges of translating hand-sent Morse code, highlighting the variability in the timing of ""mark"" and ""space"" signals.  A histogram (Figure 2) is presented to illustrate the inconsistent durations of these signals in a sample message (""CQ CQ CQ DE OPERATOR NUMBER ONE"").  The author notes that the lengths of spaces and marks are not consistently defined, making automated decoding difficult.

The article further explains that the statistical properties of Morse signals change over time, even for the same operator.  This makes it challenging for automatic decoders to adapt.  The author also points out that human operators can use contextual analysis to better understand the message, which is a capability that automatic decoders lack.

Three primary approaches to solving the hand-sent Morse translation problem are outlined:

1. **Macro:** Accumulating statistical information on a specific operator to inform decoding decisions.
2. **Micro:** Making decisions based on individual mark-to-mark intervals.
3. **Averaging:** Combining the macro and micro approaches in a hybrid algorithm.

The author notes that the first approach (macro) requires a long sample time, which can lead to unacceptable decoding delays.  The article concludes by stating that automatic decoders often fail to adapt to the variability in hand-sent Morse code.


The page also includes several figures and diagrams, but the provided image only shows a portion of the page.  The figures are referenced in the text, but not fully displayed.  The text mentions ""Figure 1"" and ""Figure 2,"" but only Figure 2 is partially visible.  The text also includes various averages and measurements related to the Morse code signals."

**Data Definitions:**  The page begins by defining the various registers and memory locations used in the program.  These include:

* **X AVGDOT:** Duration of the previous input state, and running average of the previous ""n"" dot times.
* **OUTCH:** Output ASCII character temporary buffer.
* **MORSREG:** Morse code pattern input shift register.
* **PREVSTATE:** Previous mark or space input state.
* **STATE:** Current mark or space input state.

**Flow Diagram Details:** The flow diagram itself is a visual representation of the program's logic.  It shows the program's steps in a sequential manner, using boxes and arrows to indicate the flow of control.  Key elements within the diagram include:

* **ENTRY/FOLLOWING INTERRUPT:**  Indicates the program's response to incoming Morse code signals.
* **MORSE DECODER:** The main processing block.
* **COMPUTE:**  Calculates the duration of the previous state.
* **PREVSTATE:** Stores the previous state of the input.
* **STATE:** Stores the current state of the input.
* **AVGDOT:** Calculates the average dot time.
* **SPACE/MARK:**  Indicates the presence of a space or mark in the input.
* **MORSE INTERRUPTS:**  Handles interruptions during Morse code transmission.
* **MORSE DECODER EXECUTION:**  The core decoding process.
* **OUTCH/0:**  Output of the decoded character.
* **REAL TIME:**  Indicates the program's operation in real-time.
* **CONCLUDE:**  Indicates the end of a character.
* **CLEAR MORSREG:**  Clears the Morse register.
* **RETURN:**  Indicates the end of the routine.
* **SHIFT INTO MORSREG:**  Moves data into the Morse register.
* **AVGDOT (NEW RUNNING AVERAGE):**  Calculates a new running average of dot times.

**Adaptive Features:** The text accompanying the diagram explains that the program's adaptive features are in the calculation of a new running average of the dot length whenever a dot is detected.  The speed of the algorithm's response to changes in the keying rate of the Morse input is a function of the number of dots maintained in the running average.

**Approaches and Idiosyncracies:** The text also discusses different approaches to Morse decoding, highlighting the ""ideal dot"" method and its susceptibility to noise.  It notes that the program in the diagram has some idiosyncrasies, working well for individual operators but not as reliably for a broad range of operators.

**Review/Evaluation:** The text provides a review of the program's strengths and weaknesses.  It notes the program's relative simplicity and its adaptive features, but also points out its limitations in handling various operator styles and noise.

**Note:** The page also includes a note explaining the intended use of the routine, which is to be executed following an interrupt from a Morse code detector.  It describes how the application routine should handle the output of the decoder.

**Page Continuation:** The page concludes with a statement indicating that the discussion continues on page 106.

"
45,"This page describes a Morse code transmission system, focusing on the encoding and timing mechanisms.  It's a technical document, likely from a programming manual or similar reference.

The text details how errors are handled, how characters are represented as binary strings (dots and dashes), and how the timing of the transmission is controlled.  The core of the explanation revolves around the following:

* **Error Handling:**  The system detects errors in the transmission (e.g., a spasmodic twitch causing extra dots) and treats them as special cases, modifying the data to fit the standard format before reintegrating it into the transmission.

* **Character Encoding:**  Characters are represented by a combination of dots and dashes.  The high-order bits of a byte specify the number of elements (dots/dashes) in the character, while the low-order bits represent the dots and dashes themselves.  The encoding scheme is designed to handle characters of varying lengths (up to 7 elements).  A crucial aspect is the handling of characters longer than 5 elements, which is addressed by using a ""don't-care"" bit to accommodate the extra element.

* **Timing and Spacing:**  The system uses a timing subroutine (controlled by `ELESPEED`) to generate the correct durations for dots, dashes, and spaces between elements and characters.  The timing is crucial for accurate Morse code interpretation.  The timing for spaces between characters and words is also detailed, with variations depending on whether the `ELESPEED` and `CHRSPEED` are synchronized.

* **Special Characters:**  The document acknowledges that some characters have more than five elements, which is handled by the system.

* **Data Structure:**  The page describes how the data is stored in bytes, with the count of elements in the character and the data elements themselves.

"
57,"This page contains a flow chart diagram, labeled ""Figure 2: The command interpreter routine, CMMNDR,"" which visually represents a command interpreter's process.  The diagram uses boxes and diamonds to depict different steps and decision points within the routine.

The text above the flow chart describes the processor's role in adjusting the code rate to synchronize with incoming input.  It explains how the processor arbitrarily selects an initial code speed (approximately 15 words per minute) and adjusts it based on the input code speed to maintain synchronization.  The text also notes that the processor needs to track and decode time intervals between characters, symbols, and the end of sentences, as well as arbitrary end-of-message times, all relative to a basic dot time.

The flow chart itself details the command interpreter's actions.  It shows a series of steps, including:

* **Getting new keyboard input:**  The process begins by acquiring new input.
* **Checking for the last character:**  The system checks if there's a last character in the buffer.
* **Putting new characters in the message buffer:**  New characters are added to the message buffer.
* **Deleting the last character:**  The last character is removed from the buffer.
* **Opening/closing the message buffer:**  The message buffer is opened and closed as needed.
* **Loading commands:**  The system loads commands.
* **Printing commands:**  The system prints commands.
* **Sending commands:**  The system sends commands.
* **Testing commands:**  The system tests commands.
* **Changing speed commands:**  The system handles commands to change the speed.

58,"This page contains flowcharts and descriptions related to a computer system's input/output (I/O) routines, specifically focusing on keyboard and printer interactions.

**Figure 3: Keyboard Service Routine:** This flowchart details the keyboard service routine (KYBD).  It's a simple process that checks if data is available from the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter). If data is available, it's placed into a keyboard input buffer. If the buffer is full, a bell is rung, and the incoming data is ignored.

**Figure 4: Printer Service Routine:** This flowchart describes the printer service routine (PNTR).  It checks if the UART is ready to transmit. If so, it checks if the printer buffer is not empty. If not empty, a character is sent to the UART, and the character is removed from the printer buffer.

**Software Buffer:** This section explains a software buffer management system.  It uses overlaid I/O to handle multiple operations concurrently.  The buffer is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) structure, and it tracks data transferred to and from four different buffers: message buffer, code output buffer, keyboard buffer, and printer buffer.  Each buffer has a byte count to track the number of valid data locations.  The system is designed to prevent buffer overflow errors by limiting the maximum number of locations (octal 377).  If an attempt is made to exceed this limit, an error is generated, and the offending character is ignored.  The advice given is to make the message buffer as large as possible, followed by the keyboard buffer, and then the printer buffer.

**Hardware Configuration:** This section describes the hardware environment in which the software is designed to operate.  It's designed to work on DEC Logic Products Starter Set 1 (KMP01 based) without modification.  The starter set has sufficient memory, hardware, and interfacing to allow the software to run correctly.  The least significant bit of input from device 2 is used as a sense line for code input, and the entire byte from output device 4 is used for code output.  The text continues on page 70.

**Morse Code Commands:**  This section lists special commands that can be used to modify the normal operation of the system.  These commands, sent in Morse code, include:
* **<ESC> L:** Reloads the message buffer.
* **<ESC>:** Returns to normal keyboard mode.
* **<ESC> P:** Prints the message buffer contents.
* **<ESC> S:** Ships the message.
* **<ESC> T:** A test command to send <ESC> S until an escape is typed.
* **<ESC> W:** Loads a new rate constant for WPM output.

The page is well-organized with flowcharts and detailed explanations, making it easy to understand the different components and their interactions.
