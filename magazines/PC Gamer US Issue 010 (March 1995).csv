34,"This is an article from PC Gamer magazine, dated March 1995, titled ""New Connections with Windows '95.""  It details Microsoft's plans for its own online service, the Microsoft Network (MS Network), which was slated to be a standard feature of the upcoming Windows 95 operating system.

The article discusses the following points:

* **Microsoft's Strategy:** Microsoft is positioning the MS Network to compete with established online services like CompuServe, America Online, and Prodigy.  A key strategy is to leverage Microsoft's dominant position in the PC operating system market by bundling the MS Network with Windows 95.  This would allow Microsoft to tap into a large existing user base and potentially bypass the marketing challenges faced by other online services.

* **Service Delivery:**  Crucially, Microsoft isn't intending to provide all the services itself.  Instead, the company plans to partner with third-party service providers to offer a wider range of content and functionalities.  This approach is highlighted as a way to attract high-quality providers and avoid the costs of developing and maintaining all services internally.

* **Target Audience:** Microsoft aims to attract a broad audience, including both technical users and casual consumers.  The article notes that only a small percentage of households currently subscribe to online services, leaving a large potential market for the MS Network.

* **Marketing Strategy:**  The article mentions Microsoft's plan to bundle the MS Network software with all versions of Windows 95, aiming to make it a compelling option for both new and existing Windows users.  This strategy is seen as a way to bypass the traditional marketing challenges and expenses associated with building an online service from scratch.

* **Competition:** The article acknowledges the competition from existing online services and highlights the potential for Microsoft's near-monopoly in the operating system market to give the MS Network an unfair advantage.  It also notes that other online services will need to improve their user interfaces to compete effectively.

* **User Interface:** The article emphasizes the MS Network's user-friendly interface, designed to be intuitive for new online users.  Features like drag-and-drop file transfer are highlighted as improvements over existing services.

* **Availability:** The article concludes by stating that the MS Network is expected to be available around the time of Windows 95's release, sometime in August or September 1995.


The article includes screenshots of the MS Network interface, showcasing the visual style and features of the service.  The overall tone is optimistic about the MS Network's potential to revolutionize online services, leveraging Microsoft's market dominance.

The review also mentions Commander Barr, a character in the game, and the game's plot, which involves investigating the disappearance of a survey ship near Saturn.

**Overall Rating:**

107,"This page is a review of the video game ""Hammer of the Gods,"" published in PC Gamer magazine, March 1995.

The review gives the game an 83% rating.

The review is detailed and discusses several aspects of the game:

**Gameplay:** The reviewer notes that the game's military aspect is simplistic, but the Vikings weren't known for tactical brilliance.  The game is not a typical role-playing game or strategy game, but rather a blend of elements.  It involves trade, treaties, and diplomacy, with a focus on economic aspects like plunder and agriculture.  The game features animated battle sequences with various Viking warriors, trolls, and other creatures.  The reviewer highlights the satisfying sound effects during combat, particularly the visceral sounds of bones cracking and other gruesome details.  The game allows players to choose between peaceful strategies and aggressive ones, including razing settlements and importing colonists.  The game also features quests that reward players with elite troops or magical items.  The game's progress is tracked on a ""god-tree"" diagram.  The reviewer also mentions the game's difficulty in later quests, involving frost giants, dragons, and sea serpents.

**Graphics and Sound:** The reviewer describes the graphics as ""beautifully rendered,"" particularly the way the characters fall in battle.  The animated battle sequences are praised as a highlight.  The sound effects are described as ""vivid"" and ""yuckily"" detailed, with sounds of cracking bones and other gruesome details.  The music is also highlighted, with the reviewer noting that the medieval-style music seamlessly transitions to match the game's mood changes.  The reviewer specifically mentions the composers Rob Lefebvre and Bruce Nunley for their contributions to the soundtrack.

It also lists the MSRP as $69.95.  The review highlights the game's grand slam on the surface, but notes that the actual gameplay is disappointing.

**Gameplay and Features:** The review discusses the game's ability to simulate Major League Baseball, including the choice of famous ballparks.  It points out the impressive SVGA menus and opening screens, which set the stage for the game.  However, the review criticizes the gameplay, noting that the graphics are chunky and VGA, and the graphics are dated.  The play-by-play commentary, while good, is hampered by its halting delivery.  The review also mentions the game's simulation features, including real Major League teams and players, performance based on 1994 statistics, fast simulation of computer games, a schedule builder, and stats-keeping.

**Review of the Game's Strengths and Weaknesses:** The review highlights the game's impressive introductory video and menus.

The review also mentions that Sony Imagesoft is planning a series of sports sims for the PC, and hopes that future games will be better.

The review itself is divided into several sections.  The first section provides a general overview of the game, highlighting the developer's attempt to improve upon the classic Lemmings formula.

A significant portion of the review focuses on the gameplay mechanics.

Specific criticisms are made regarding the new ""lock-on lemming"" control, which the reviewer finds cumbersome and less intuitive than the original method.  The reviewer also comments on the graphical changes, noting that the lemmings are larger and fewer in number, but that this change doesn't significantly impact the game's charm.

The review also touches on the game's interface, specifically the introduction of toolboxes containing skills.  The reviewer finds this addition to be more frustrating than helpful, as it adds unnecessary complexity to the already challenging gameplay.

The review concludes with a final verdict score of 77%, along with a breakdown of the pros and cons (highs and lows).

111,"This page is a review of the video game ""Zephyr,"" published in PC Gamer magazine, March 1995.

The review gives the game a score of 48%.

**Game Overview:**

The review describes ""Zephyr"" as a science fiction action shooter where players fly heavily armed hovercrafts in a future where political and economic conflicts have been replaced by a sanctioned blood sport.  The player controls the hovercraft for corporate sponsors, battling other corporations for control of galactic resources.

**Review Details:**

The review criticizes several aspects of the game:

* **Unforgivably Choppy Performance:**  Even on a relatively fast 66MHz 486 machine with graphics set to the minimum, the game runs very slowly, making it difficult to control the action.
* **Disappointing Graphics:** The 3D scrolling backgrounds are cluttered with meaningless detail, making it hard to target enemies.  The review notes that the lack of clarity makes it difficult to see and target enemies.
* **Poor Documentation:** The manual is criticized for being poorly written, with more than half of the 32 pages devoted to a novelette rather than gameplay instructions.  Crucially, important information about the game's mechanics is missing.
* **Incomplete Features:**  A key feature advertised on the game box, multiplayer support, was missing from the reviewed version.  The review notes that the publisher promised a free upgrade to add this feature, but it was not yet available.
* **Unpolished Product:** The review suggests the game may have been rushed to market, possibly to capitalize on holiday sales.  The game feels unfinished and not ready for release.

**Positive Aspects:**

Despite the criticisms, the review does acknowledge some positive aspects:

* **Sound Effects and Music:** The game's sound effects and music are described as good.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The review concludes that ""Zephyr"" is a disappointing action game, particularly given the incomplete features and poor documentation.  The reviewer recommends that New World Computing focus on strategy and RPG games instead of action titles.  The review highlights the game's rushed release and lack of polish, suggesting that the game may not be ready for release.

* **Missions:** The missions involve taking over alien bases, buildings, and ships, and ultimately destroying the source of the alien threat.

* **Gameplay Mechanics:** The review notes that the game has a more complex control scheme than ""Doom,"" requiring the player to adapt to new controls for jumping, aiming, and movement.

The review also includes a section on obtaining a demo of the game through a bulletin board system (BBS) called ""Doom Mania BBS.""  The BBS provides access to the demo and other shareware games, including ""Heretic.""

The review concludes with a final verdict, giving the game an 81% rating.  The review highlights both the positive aspects (good features, similar to Doom, but with unique elements) and the negative aspects (awkward movement while shooting, and the use of full-motion video clips).
