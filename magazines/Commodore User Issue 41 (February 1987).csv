103,"This page is a review of Tynesoft's Music Synthesizer, a software package for the Commodore 16 and Plus/4 computers.

**Review:**

The review, written by Fred Reid, gives a mixed assessment of the software.  The reviewer praises the sound editor, calling it a definite improvement over the composer, and highlighting the wide variety of functions it offers (glide, vibrato, tremolo, pitch bend, ADSR, etc.).  The six-step dynamic filter is also noted as a positive feature, allowing for unique sound creation.

However, the review also points out several shortcomings.  The manual, while cassette-sized and containing 12 pages, is deemed insufficient, with some areas of the package's functionality remaining unclear even after extended use.  The reviewer criticizes the lack of proper stave notation, the absence of a metronome, and the limitations of the editing capabilities.  Specifically, the editing is limited to altering pitch and length of notes, with no ability to copy or repeat blocks of notes or to create key or time signatures.  The system's approach to note length is also criticized, as it assigns note lengths based on how long a key is held down, rather than allowing for more nuanced musical timing.

**Overall Rating:**

While the review acknowledges the software's potential, it ultimately concludes that the package is not perfect.  The reviewer highlights the lack of professional features, such as proper stave notation and a metronome, as significant drawbacks.

**Product Details:**

The page also includes details about the product, including:

* **Name:** Music Synthesizer C16 and Plus/4

The author, identified as ""Tommy,"" is presented as an expert in the field, emphasizing the ease of the process.

**Section 2: Example 1: Copying Character Data from ROM to RAM**

This section provides a detailed example of how to copy character data from the computer's Read-Only Memory (ROM) to Random Access Memory (RAM).  It includes a series of 80 lines of code (POKE statements) that perform this task.  The code is presented in a numbered list, with explanations for each line.  The purpose is to allow the user to modify existing characters or add new ones.

**Section 3: Example 2: Defining and Displaying a Character**

This section details how to define a new character (or replace an existing one) and display it on the screen.  It includes a program example (100-170 lines) with instructions and data.  The code uses the `READ` command to load character data and `POKE` to store it in RAM.  The example also explains how to revert to the standard character set.

**Section 4: Defining Characters**

This section explains the fundamental structure of characters on the C16/Plus/4.  It describes how each character is defined by a set of 8 bytes (64 pixels) of data.  A diagram (Figure 1) illustrates how the letter ""A"" is defined.  The section also mentions the ability to create reversed characters.

"
116,"This page is a section from a computer magazine, likely a Commodore 64 magazine, focused on programming tips.  It's part of a larger article series, as indicated by the ""Tommy's Tips"" header.

The page contains two main sections, each with a different example.

**Section 1 (Example 3):**

This section details a series of data values (numbers) likely intended for use in a Commodore 64 program.  The data is presented in a numbered list (100, 110, 120, etc.) and each line contains a description and a set of numbers.  The text suggests these numbers are used to define character attributes or graphics data.  The description ""READ CH: POKE16304+(AD*8)+BT, CH"" implies that the data is used to load or modify graphics in memory.  The ""NEXT BT, AD"" and ""FOR"" loops suggest a pattern for loading the data.  The ""DATA"" lines contain the actual numerical data.

**Section 2 (Example 4):**

This section presents a Commodore 64 BASIC program.  It's a series of commands (e.g., `IF C=0 THEN 460`, `GOSUB 1000`, `GOTO460`) that likely control the movement and positioning of a character or object on the screen.  The numbers (e.g., 400, 405, 410, etc.) are likely line numbers in the program.  The code uses `GOSUB` to call subroutines (1000, 1020, 1040, 1060) for specific actions.  The code also uses variables like `X`, `Y`, and `C` to control the character's position and response to user input.  The section includes a description of how to use the code to move a character on the screen.

**Section 3 (Using Your UDGS in a Game):**

This section explains how to use User Defined Graphics (UDGs) in Commodore 64 games.  It describes two common uses: creating background graphics and representing moving objects.  It also explains how combining UDGs into strings can be used to move multiple objects at once, but with a slight performance penalty compared to moving individual objects.  The section includes an example (Example 5) that shows how to create a simple background and move a character across the screen.  It also describes how the space bar can be used as a ""fire"" button.

**Overall:**

The page provides practical programming examples for Commodore 64 users, focusing on character movement, screen graphics, and using UDGs in games.  The examples are presented in a clear, step-by-step format, with explanations of the code and its intended use.  The page is likely from a magazine article, as it provides practical tips and examples for programmers.
"
117,"This page contains information about extending the use of User-Defined Graphics (UDGs) on the Commodore 16 and Commodore Plus/4 computers.

**Section 1: Extending UDGs**

The text at the top of the page explains that the examples provided only cover single-color characters.  It highlights that UDGs can be multi-colored, but the standard character set isn't designed for this, requiring more work.  Multi-color mode has a reduced horizontal resolution (4x8 instead of 8x8) and requires two points to represent each color.  Extended Color Mode is also mentioned, allowing four colors for the background but limiting the available characters to 64.  The text emphasizes that more details are available in the C16/Plus 4 Reference Book, published by ANCO, and recommends purchasing it for in-depth knowledge.

**Section 2: Example 5 (Code Listing)**

This section presents a series of Commodore 64/Plus 4 assembly language commands (e.g., `250 SCNCLR`, `260 CHAR 1,6,8, ""I""`).  These lines of code are likely part of a program that manipulates UDGs, controlling colors, positions, and other attributes.  The code demonstrates how to create and modify characters using UDGs.  The code includes instructions for setting colors, printing characters, and using variables like `AX`, `AY`, `PX`, `PY`, `X`, and `Y`.  The code also includes conditional statements (`IF`, `THEN`) and subroutine calls (`GOSUB`).

**Section 3: Figures 1, 3**

These figures show grid patterns. Figure 1 displays a grid pattern that resembles the letter ""A"". Figure 3 shows another grid pattern, with varying numerical values in each cell.  These figures likely represent the layout or structure of the UDGs being defined or manipulated in the code examples.

**Section 4: Figure 2**

This figure presents a table with two rows. The first row, labeled ""posn:"", lists numbers from 7 down to 0. The second row, labeled ""value:"", lists corresponding numerical values (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1). This table likely defines the position and value of elements within the grid patterns shown in Figures 1 and 3.

**Section 5: UDG's on the C16 and Plus/4**
