The graphics are highlighted as a key improvement.  The review also mentions that the original game was well-received, and the sequel builds on that success.

* **Publisher:** Virgin
* **ETA:** January
* **Rating/Summary:** This is a follow-up to the moderately successful *Spirit of Excalibur*.  The review highlights the continuation of the arcade and fantasy role-playing styles.

The game involves controlling forces on a map and zooming into scene levels for searches, conversations, and fights.

The page contains several sections, each dedicated to a different game:

**1. STEEL EMPIRE:**

* **Publisher:** Millennium
* **ETA:** February
* **Review:**  The review describes *Steel Empire* as a future-war strategy game with a ""cyborg-filled tale of world domination.""  It uses real-time combat and slick graphics.  The reviewer notes that the game is aimed more at the regular Amiga gamer than the hardcore strategist.  The upside is that the game's graphics are well above average for the genre, and the scenario, while not original, is coherent.  The downside is that crossovers (combining elements from different games) might not appeal to everyone.  The review concludes with a prediction of ""As good as Battle Isle's, basically.""


**2. GUY SPY:**

* **Publisher:** Readysoft
* **ETA:** March
* **Review:**  *Guy Spy* is described as having Don Bluth-style graphics, similar to *Dragon's Lair* and *Space Ace*.  The reviewer notes that while the animation is good, the movement isn't as free as in other sprite-based games.  The plot is a James Bond-style spy story.  The upside is that the game will look good in magazines.  The downside is that it remains to be seen if the game will be a worthwhile experience.  The review concludes with a ""Fair to middling"" rating.


**3. TURBOCHARGE:**

* **Publisher:** System 3
* **ETA:** April

The upside is that it has an impressive 3D effect and is a decent driving and shooting game.  The downside is that conversions from the C64 are often poor, and comparisons to *Lotus 2* are inevitable.  The review concludes with a prediction that the game looks promising but needs further development to meet Amiga standards.


**4. SILLY PUTTY:**

* **Publisher:** System 3
* **ETA:** May
* **Review:**  *Silly Putty* is a platformer with a ""suitably daft plot"" where the player controls a blob.  The upside is that the game has cute graphics and a wonderfully pliable character.  The downside is that the game's platforming elements are overly frustrating due to insufficient playtesting.  The review concludes with a prediction that the game will either be a big hit or a monumental anti-climax.


**5. MATCH OF THE DAY:**

* **Publisher:** Impulze
* **ETA:** March
* **Review:**  *Match of the Day* is a footy (soccer) license that focuses on the strategy side of running a sports show, rather than the actual game itself.  The upside is that if the TV aspect is well-executed, it could be a fun strategy management game.  The downside is that it might not appeal to everyone.

71,"This page is an article from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, from February 1992.  It's a section titled ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"" focusing on the artwork and packaging design of various Amiga games.

The article features reviews (or at least critiques) of several games, focusing on their box art.  It's not a traditional review of gameplay, but rather an assessment of the visual appeal and effectiveness of the game's packaging.

**Specific sections and their descriptions:**

* **SIM CITY (Infogrames) / MOONBASE (Wesson International/Mindscape):**  The article criticizes the Moonbase box art as ""dark, featureless, and unimaginative,"" contrasting it with the ""classic"" and ""photogenic"" design of the Sim City box.  It highlights the strong visual appeal of the Sim City box.

* **XENON 2 (Image Works) / AMNIOS (Psygnosis):**  The article praises the ""powerful image"" of the Xenon 2 box, but notes the similar style of the Amnios box, questioning why the Amnios box doesn't stand out more.  It suggests the artwork of the Amnios box is high quality but blends in with other Psygnosis boxes.

* **IVANHOE (Ocean) / HEART OF THE DRAGON (Avatar Consulting):**  The article praises the consistent use of the same artist (Bob Wakelin) in the Ocean boxes, particularly highlighting the ""tightness of the composition"" and the larger, overlapping images in Ivanhoe.  It contrasts this with a less successful box for Heart of the Dragon, noting the similar artwork but less effective composition.

* **THE CYCLES (Accolade) / INDIANAPOLIS 500 (Electronic Arts):**  The article critiques the Indianapolis 500 box as ""too fussy"" with its design elements, contrasting it with the ""strong image"" of the Accolade box.  It notes the Accolade box's effective use of a tightly cropped photo and clear lettering.

* **NIGHTSHIFT (Lucasfilm) / POP UP (Infogrames):**  The article notes the difficulty in illustrating puzzle games, leading to ""diabolical box artwork"" in some cases.  It praises the Night Shift box for its ""cartoony conveyor belts"" and ""stylised versions of famous characters,"" but criticizes the Pop Up box as ""ropily executed"" and confusing.

**Overall:** The article is a subjective assessment of the visual appeal of game boxes, highlighting what works well and what falls short.  It's not a comprehensive review of the games themselves, but rather a commentary on the design choices made for their packaging.  The review rating is not explicitly stated, but the tone suggests a mixed bag of positive and negative opinions.

72,"This page is from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, featuring a section titled ""Artwork Special: The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.""  It showcases various game box covers for Amiga computers, critiquing their design elements.

The page details several game box covers, each with a brief review/analysis.  The reviews are not formal, but rather informal observations on the aesthetics and effectiveness of the artwork.

**Specific Game Box Cover Reviews:**

* **A-10 Tank Killer (Dynamix/ProFlight):** The reviewer criticizes the cover's design, noting the close-up, extreme view of the aircraft, bold lettering, and a large yellow sun. However, the reviewer points out that the design is flawed by a large amount of empty space and a dull, emotionless computer-generated look to the artwork.

* **Tetris (Infogrames) / Loopz (Audiogenic):** The reviewer notes that the difference between good and bad artwork is less clear for these games.  Tetris is praised for its attempt to illustrate the gameplay, while Loopz is criticized for its lack of connection to the game itself.

* **Life & Death (Mindscape) / Germ Crazy (Electronic Zoo):** The reviewer finds the Life & Death cover to be effective in grabbing attention with its ""You are the surgeon!"" line, but the image is from the patient's perspective.  Germ Crazy is described as potentially funny, but the illustration is deemed quite bad.

* **Wolf Pack (Mirrorsoft) / East vs West: Berlin 1948 (Rainbow Arts):** The reviewer criticizes the Wolf Pack cover for its overly large text and a picture that is too busy.  The Berlin 1948 cover is also criticized for its busy artwork and illegible lettering.

* **Their Finest Hour (Lucasfilm) / Nam (Domark):** The reviewer praises the Lucasfilm cover for its WW2-style artwork and restrained lettering, calling it classy.  The Nam cover is compared unfavorably, deemed less classy and more like a Commando-style action game.

* **Elvira (Accolade) / Saint & Greavsie (Grandslam):** The reviewer notes that the Elvira cover benefits from the celebrity sponsorship, but the Grandslam cover is criticized as poorly designed, with small text and a lack of thought behind the publicity shot.

**Overall:**
