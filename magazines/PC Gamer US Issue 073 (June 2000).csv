72,"This page is from a 2000 issue of PC Gamer magazine, featuring reviews and previews of video games.

The page focuses on several simulation games, including:

* **Crimson Skies:**  A ""soft"" narrative sim set in an alternate 1920s America.  It's described as a wild confection of alternate history, pulp fiction, and aerial dogfighting.  The game is drawn from a 1998 board game and features aerial pirates as the protagonists.  The review highlights the game's imaginative setting, explosive action, and potential to revitalize the flight sim market.  It mentions the use of in-engine cutscenes and a focus on fanciful aircraft and outrageous acrobatics.  The review also notes the game's potential to appeal to action gamers.

* **Midtown Madness 2:**  A free-range urban driving game set in San Francisco and London.  The review praises the improved multiplayer options, including ""cops and robbers"" scenarios, and the Crash Course mode with scripted scenarios.  It's described as the best free-range urban driving game on PC, and the sequel is expected to build on the original's reputation for realism and fun.  The review mentions the DB-7 engine, which has been tweaked for more realistic physics and detailed graphics.

* **B-17 Flying Fortress II: The Mighty Eighth:** A bomber simulation game.  The review notes that bomber sims are typically dull due to a lack of speed and maneuverability compared to fighter games.  However, this game attempts to address this by making tactical flight planning a key element.  Players can switch among ten different crew positions, move to hotspots to fire guns, fly, and bomb, and even take control of an escort fighter.  The review highlights the detailed crew positions and the thrill of piloting a heavy bomber, but acknowledges that bombing sims are often less popular due to limited mass market appeal.


The page also includes a general introduction to the video game simulation genre, noting the cancellation of some projects and the genre's shift in focus.

The review is largely negative, giving the game a 48% rating, categorized as ""Tolerable.""

**Review Summary:** The reviewer criticizes the game's performance, graphics, and gameplay mechanics.  While acknowledging the ""Play Against the Pros"" online feature as a noteworthy concept, the reviewer ultimately finds the game's technical shortcomings outweigh its strengths.

The game's difficulty curve is also criticized, with the pro level being too difficult and the beginner level too easy.  The reviewer suggests a missing difficulty level for average players.
* **Gimmicks:** While acknowledging the face-import feature and the online play, the reviewer sees these as gimmicks that don't compensate for the core gameplay problems.
* **System Requirements:** The review points out that the game's recommended system requirements are significantly higher than the suggested ones, indicating a performance problem.

* **Online Feature:** The ""Play Against the Pros"" online feature is mentioned as a potentially interesting concept, but the reviewer notes that it wasn't fully functional at the time of the review.
* **Course Design:** The season mode and course architecture are mentioned as potentially good ideas, but the reviewer notes that the courses are difficult to navigate.

The article is divided into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the tune file:

**1.  Making Contact:** This section details the five bat settings and how they affect the ball's reaction off the bat.  The author discusses how the default settings produce too much ""solid contact"" and suggests adjusting them to create more realistic results, including a higher incidence of foul balls.

145,"This page is an opinion piece, likely from a magazine, reviewing a wargame called ""The Operational Art of War.""  The author, William R. Trotter, is critical of the wargaming community and the reception of the game.

**Review Title:** ""Seas Wrung from Damp Rags...""

**Review Rating:**  While there isn't a numerical rating, the overall tone of the review is negative and critical of the wargaming community's reaction to the game.

**Review Content:**

The review begins with a quote from Julius Caesar, then delves into the author's perspective on the wargaming community, particularly the ""grognards"" (veteran wargamers).  He argues that this group often exhibits a sense of superiority and a tendency to criticize games harshly, focusing on minor flaws and exaggerating their significance.

The author uses the example of the game ""The Operational Art of War"" (TOAW) to illustrate his point.  He describes the negative reception the game received in online forums and newsgroups, where players focused on a single, easily reproducible glitch in one scenario, and criticized the game's realism.  He argues that this criticism was disproportionate and that the game's flaws were not as significant as the community made them out to be.

The author contends that the wargaming community's harsh criticism has contributed to the decline of wargames in the retail market.  He cites sales figures for TOAW as evidence, noting the low sales compared to the game's potential.

The author concludes by urging the wargaming community to be more understanding and less critical of games. He suggests that wargamers are, at heart, still children playing with toy soldiers in an electronic sandbox, and that they should lighten up.

The page also includes a screenshot of the game's map and interface, providing a visual representation of the game's mechanics.  The screenshot shows a tactical map with units and terrain features.
