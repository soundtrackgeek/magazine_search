41,"This page is a review of the video game ""Block Out"" for the Amiga computer system, published in Amiga Format magazine, issue 41.

The review, written by Maff Evans, gives the game an overall rating of 84%.

**Game Overview:**

The review describes ""Block Out"" as a puzzle game similar to Tetris, but with a 3D twist.  Instead of simple shapes, the game uses solid 3D objects that can be rotated in three axes.  The goal is to stack these objects in a square well to form layers, and complete layers are removed.  The game becomes progressively more challenging as the well gets deeper and the blocks become more complex.  The game features three different block sets (Flat, Basic, and Extended) with varying shapes and sizes, and the difficulty is adjusted by the well size, block depth, and starting speed.

**Graphics and Sound:**

The graphics are described as clear and colorful, with smoothly shifting shapes. The sound is minimal, with the most noticeable element being the classical loading music.  The sound is used sparingly to provide effects when layers are completed.

**Gameplay and Lasting Interest:**

The gameplay is described as fairly easy to get into, but the 3D rotation required to fit the blocks can be a challenge.  The system isn't overly complex, but the game becomes more compulsive as the player masters the art of layer building.  The review notes that the options for block sets, well size, and speed can add significant challenge.

**Judgment:**

The reviewer initially suggests that the game might be a simple rip-off of ""Welltris,"" but quickly refutes this, stating that ""Block Out"" is a true 3D puzzle game that requires thinking in three dimensions.  The reviewer emphasizes the game's unique character and challenging gameplay, concluding that it will appeal to many players.

**Technical Details:**

The review mentions the game's price (£19.99) and the available control methods (mouse/keyboard).

**Additional Notes:**

The page includes a visual representation of the game's gameplay, showing the 3D blocks in a grid-like well.  There are also screenshots of the game's interface, displaying elements like score, level, and high scores.  The review also includes a section on the game's different modes of play.  A final note cautions players about the depth of the well, suggesting it might be problematic for claustrophobic players.

The game's background is described as ""swirling surreal"" and the soundtrack as ""eerily atmospheric,"" making the game instantly appealing.

The reviewer points out that while the one-on-one mode is great, the lack of long-term solo appeal is a significant drawback, even with pre-configured boards.

**Overall Rating:** The review gives the game an overall score of 81%.

**Game Description:** The game is a murder mystery adventure where the player takes on the role of a detective.  The game is set in a mansion, and the player must investigate the scene, interview suspects, collect clues, and solve the crime within a two-hour time limit.

The objects are easily visible, but the suspects have identical stock appearances (butlers, maids, etc.).  The side-screen graphics, however, make up for this with enlarged finger prints and a hand-written notebook.  The sound effects are described as ""promising"" but not particularly impactful, with taps, drips, and gravel sounds.

**Gameplay and Lasting Interest:** The game is designed to be challenging, with different murders to solve every day, and four skill levels (amateur to supersleuth).  The review highlights the complexity of the plots and the need for dogged questioning of suspects.  The game's lasting interest is emphasized by the variety of murders and the increasing complexity of the plots.

163,"This page is a review section from a magazine, likely *Amiga Format*, focused on educational software for the Amiga computer.  It details three programs, all titled ""Soft Stuff,""  and priced at £19.95 each.

**Review of ""Soft Stuff"" (Things to Do With Words):**

The review begins with a description of the program ""Soft Stuff,"" which focuses on teaching children about words.  It highlights three different games:

* **Anagrams:**  This game presents a list of normal words, randomly selects one, and displays it as an anagram.  The user must use the mouse and an onscreen alphabet to select the correct letters to solve the anagram.
* **Sentences:**  This game jumbles up a sentence on the screen.  The user must select the words and arrange them in the correct order.  The program provides assistance after a few incorrect attempts.
* **Word Hunt:**  This game presents a word, and the user must create as many other words as possible using the letters from the original word.  The program displays possible solutions.

The review notes that the program attempts to help children understand sentence structure and word meanings, rather than rote memorization.  It also points out a minor design flaw: the ""End"" icon is sometimes poorly placed, potentially causing the user to accidentally exit the program.  The reviewer finds the program generally well-designed and suitable for children aged 5-12.

**Review of ""Soft Stuff"" (Things to Do With Numbers):**

This section reviews a different ""Soft Stuff"" program focused on numeracy.  The reviewer expresses disappointment with this program, stating that the way to access the different parts of the program is somewhat cumbersome.  The program includes:

* **Train Fill:**  The user must place the correct number of passengers on a train, using specific numbers.
* **Book Search:**  A game where the user searches for a bookworm on a grid, using a thermometer to guide them.
* **Time Teller:**  This game helps children learn the 24-hour clock system.  The user enters times on a calculator-style keypad.

The reviewer finds the program somewhat simplistic and not as engaging as the ""Things to Do With Words"" program.

**Conclusion:**

The overall conclusion of the review is mixed.  While the ""Things to Do With Words"" program is praised for its innovative approach to teaching vocabulary, the ""Things to Do With Numbers"" program is deemed less effective.  The reviewer highlights the ""window dressing"" aspect of the programs, suggesting that while they might be helpful for some children, they may not be as effective as other educational software.
