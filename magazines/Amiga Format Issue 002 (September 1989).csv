75,"This page is an article from *Amiga Format* magazine, likely from the 1980s or early 1990s, focused on desktop publishing (DTP) software.  It features a review and comparison of two DTP programs: City Desk and Shakespeare.

**City Desk Review:**

The review section on City Desk highlights its powerful page creation capabilities, but criticizes its user interface.  It's described as a powerful program, but the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers) interface is considered cumbersome, potentially leading to frustration during the learning process.  The article notes that the program is well-suited for documents with a consistent style, but less ideal for complex layouts.  The review also mentions the upcoming City Desk V2.0, which is expected to have significant enhancements, including a full-screen text editor, a new graphics editor, and the ability to move columns.  The reviewer anticipates a more user-friendly product with the new version and a revised manual.  The price is mentioned as £130.39 plus VAT.

**Shakespeare Review:**

The review of Shakespeare focuses on its affordability and color capabilities.  It's praised for allowing color to be carried through to printed output, a significant advantage over other DTP programs at the time.  However, the review also points out limitations, such as the greyscale output from the PostScript printer, the lack of full-color separation, and the somewhat unusual workflow.  The program's method of working with frames and pre-loaded elements is described as initially unusual but manageable once understood.  The review also notes that the program is easy to use once the basic format is established.  The price is mentioned as being significantly reduced.

**General Information:**

The page includes screenshots of both programs' interfaces, demonstrating the different features and functionalities.  The article also discusses the importance of page layout, text formatting, and graphic elements in DTP.

The author emphasizes that this technique leverages the Amiga's blitter for faster redrawing.

**Section 2:  C Compiler Issues and Solutions**

This section addresses problems encountered when using a C compiler on an Amiga.  A user reports that the machine is not recognizing the 'CC' command when trying to compile a C program.  The article explains that the user needs a C compiler (like Lattice or Aztec) to compile C programs.  It also clarifies that different C compilers use different file names for their commands.  The article recommends Lattice C as the best available compiler for the Amiga, and provides contact information for purchasing it.

**Section 3:  Amiga Pointer Customization**

This section details a user's problem with customizing the mouse pointer in different operating system environments (Workbench and PD disks).  The user is unable to change the pointer on a Seventeen Bit Software disk, despite successfully modifying the pointer on the Workbench disk.  The article suggests that the problem might be related to how the system configuration files are handled when booting different disks.

**Section 4:  Aztec-Nical (Amiga C for Beginners) Review**

This section is a review or a user's experience with the book ""Amiga C for Beginners.""  The user highlights a problem encountered while following the book's instructions for using the C compiler.  The user found that the book's examples relied on a specific compiler (Manx) and that using a different compiler (Aztec) might require adjustments.
