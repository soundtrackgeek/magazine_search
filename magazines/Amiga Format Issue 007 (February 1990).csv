The author then contrasts this with the advantages of newer, more powerful computers and software, like the Amiga, and the programs used by Karl Torok.

**Review of Karl Torok's Work:** The article describes Torok's artistic process, starting with selecting images from a theme, often in collaboration with poets, or from his own photographs or postcards.  It emphasizes the time-consuming nature of creating each picture, often taking weeks or months.  The article notes that Torok's work often features scenes from around his home in the Pennines, or from Florida and California.  It also mentions the use of old photographs and postcards as a source of inspiration.

**Technical Description of the Process:** The article details the technical aspects of Torok's process, including the use of digitization, color reduction (to 8 or 32 colors), and the use of software like DigiView, Transfer 24, Deluxe Paint III, Deluxe PhotoLab, and DigiPaint3.  It explains how Torok uses a plotter to create the dotted images, instead of a dot-matrix or ink-jet printer.  The article highlights the physical constraints of traditional methods and how the Amiga's capabilities allow for greater experimentation and flexibility.  It also mentions the use of a BBC computer and digitizer in earlier stages of the process.

**Software and Program Details:** The article describes the software used, including a program written in Basic and compiled on an Amiga, and a plotter driver.  It explains how the software allows for the creation of a dotted image, and the speed improvements compared to manual methods.

**Artistic Style:** The article describes Torok's artistic style as pointillism, where thousands of small dots of color are used to create an image.  It notes that viewed from a distance, the dots merge to create a full range of hues.

**Conclusion:** The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of the Amiga's capabilities in allowing Torok to overcome the limitations of traditional methods and create his unique style of pointillist artwork.  It also mentions the use of random variations in the dots to avoid uniformity.

**Visual Elements:** The page includes several images of Karl Torok's artwork, showcasing the pointillist style.  These images are likely reproductions of his work.

The review is structured into several sections:

**Game Overview:** The review begins by describing the game's premise, highlighting its presentation at the 1989 London Amusement Trades Exhibition.  It was presented as a highly realistic racing simulator, and the Amiga version is now available.  The game features two tracks, ""speed"" and ""stunt,"" and players can choose between automatic or manual transmission.  The review emphasizes the importance of mastering gear shifting and handling the car at high speeds (over 100 mph) for successful completion of the tracks.  The review also notes the presence of checkpoints and the ""Champ' Lap"" as a challenging aspect of the game.

**Gameplay Mechanics:** The review details the gameplay mechanics, including the need to choose a track, the time constraints, and the importance of speed and steering skills, especially on the stunt track with its loop-the-loop and high-banking sections.  It also mentions the presence of on-coming traffic as a hazard in the game.

**Graphics and Sound:** The review comments on the 3D graphics, noting a good impression of speed, but also criticizing the basic design of other road users.  The instant replay feature is praised.  The sound effects are heavily criticized as weak and lacking in quality, despite the reviewer acknowledging that the sound effects are likely taken from the arcade version.

**Lasting Interest and Judgement:** The review notes that while the game is initially challenging, mastering the controls and tracks leads to more consistent performance.  However, the reviewer argues that the game's simulation aspects, while present, don't make it particularly engaging or interesting in the long run.  The review also points out the presence of bugs, such as the game restarting on a different track, which detracts from the overall experience.  The reviewer concludes that while the conversion to Amiga is commendable, the game's core gameplay, stripped of the arcade's feedback mechanisms, is not particularly compelling.

**Reviewer's Conclusion:** The review concludes by stating that while the conversion to Amiga is well-executed, the game's core gameplay, stripped of the arcade's feedback mechanisms, is not particularly compelling.

**Graphics and Sound:** The review criticizes the graphics as ""blocky"" and ""simple,"" though acknowledging they are colorful.  The sound effects are described as ""grating rather than satisfying.""  The text-based AI programming interface, however, is praised for its futuristic typeface.

**Judgement:** The reviewer notes an obsessive quality to the game, suggesting it's a game that can be played for extended periods.  The reviewer also points out that the game is more cerebral than a typical shoot-em-up, appealing to players who enjoy problem-solving and puzzle elements.

127,"This page is an article from Amiga Format magazine, specifically a section titled ""Coping With Failure.""  It's a troubleshooting guide for common AmigaDOS error messages.

The article explains various AmigaDOS error codes (numbered 103 through 232) and what they mean in plain English.  Each error code is described individually, explaining the likely cause of the problem and how to potentially resolve it.

For example, error 103 (""insufficient free store"") indicates that the Amiga doesn't have enough memory to load a program.  The article suggests shutting down unnecessary tasks and closing unused windows to free up resources.  Similarly, error 120 (""argument line invalid or too long"") means the program received incorrect parameters, and error 202 (""object in use"") means another program is using a file that the current program is trying to modify.

The article provides detailed explanations for each error, including specific examples and suggestions for resolving the issue.  It also covers more complex scenarios, such as error 213 (""disk not validated""), which indicates a corrupted disk, and error 215 (""rename across devices attempted""), which explains that renaming a file across different devices is not possible.

The article is clearly written for users familiar with the Amiga operating system and command-line interface (CLI).  It's not a beginner's guide, but rather a helpful resource for experienced Amiga users trying to diagnose and fix problems.

The page also includes a note at the end, stating that the article covers errors 103 to 218, and that the remaining errors (219-232) will be covered in the next issue of Amiga Format.  The page is part of a larger magazine article, as indicated by the ""AMIGA FORMAT 127"" at the bottom.
