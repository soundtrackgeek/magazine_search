It highlights the frustration of printouts not matching the screen's visual appeal.  The author then contrasts this with the advantages of newer, more powerful computers and software, like the Amiga, and the programs used by Karl Torok.

**Review of Karl Torok's Work:** The article describes Torok's artistic process, starting with selecting images from a theme, often in collaboration with poets, or from his own photographs or postcards.  It emphasizes the time-consuming nature of creating each picture, often taking weeks or months.  The article notes that Torok's work often features scenes from around his home in the Pennines, or from Florida and California.  It also mentions the use of old photographs and postcards as a source of inspiration.

**Technical Description of the Process:** The article details the technical aspects of Torok's process, including the use of digitization, color reduction (to 8 or 32 colors), and the use of software like DigiView, Transfer 24, Deluxe Paint III, Deluxe PhotoLab, and DigiPaint3.  It explains how Torok uses a plotter to create the dotted images, instead of a dot-matrix or ink-jet printer.  The article highlights the physical constraints of traditional methods and how the Amiga's capabilities allow for greater experimentation and flexibility.  It also mentions the use of a BBC computer and digitizer in earlier stages of the process.

**Software and Program Details:** The article describes the software used, including a program written in Basic and compiled on an Amiga, and a plotter driver.  It explains how the software allows for the creation of a dotted image, and the speed improvements compared to manual methods.

**Artistic Style:** The article describes Torok's artistic style as pointillism, where thousands of small dots of color are used to create an image.  It notes that viewed from a distance, the dots merge to create a full range of hues.

**Conclusion:** The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of the Amiga's capabilities in allowing Torok to overcome the limitations of traditional methods and create his unique style of pointillist artwork.  It also mentions the use of random variations in the dots to avoid uniformity.

**Visual Elements:** The page includes several images of Karl Torok's artwork, showcasing the pointillist style.  These images are likely reproductions of his work.

The article also explains how the color palette of the original image is linked to the pens used, allowing for accurate reproduction of colors in the final image.  The example given is that a particular shade of green in the original might be represented by a combination of black, green, and red dots in the final print.

The text also mentions specific examples of artwork created using both the original BBC program and the Amiga version.  It notes that the ""FLORAL ORGAN"" and ""LISTER PARK"" images were made with the BBC program, while ""FLORIDA"" and ""CALIFORNIA"" were created using the Amiga.  The article points out that the Amiga versions used a wider range of dot, square, and cross-hatch patterns, resulting in clearer and brighter images.  A final point is made that while some of the recent images might appear slightly overworked with pastels, the underlying ""dotted"" nature of the artwork is still evident.  The author concludes by emphasizing the surprising ability of computers to produce such high-quality artwork."

34,"This page is a review of the Amiga version of the game ""Hard Drivin',"" published by Domark.  The review, written by Andy Smith, gives the game an overall rating of 50%.

The review is structured into several sections:

**Game Overview:** The review begins by describing the game's premise, highlighting its presentation at the 1989 London Amusement Trades Exhibition.  It was presented as a highly realistic racing simulator, and the Amiga version is now available.  The game features two tracks, ""speed"" and ""stunt,"" and players can choose between automatic or manual transmission.  The review emphasizes the importance of mastering gear shifting and handling the car at high speeds (over 100 mph) for successful completion of the tracks.  The review also notes the presence of checkpoints and the ""Champ' Lap"" as a challenging aspect of the game.

**Gameplay Mechanics:** The review details the gameplay mechanics, including the need to choose a track, the time constraints, and the importance of speed and steering skills, especially on the stunt track with its loop-the-loop and high-banking sections.  It also mentions the presence of on-coming traffic as a hazard in the game.

**Graphics and Sound:** The review comments on the 3D graphics, noting a good impression of speed, but also criticizing the basic design of other road users.  The instant replay feature is praised.  The sound effects are heavily criticized as weak and lacking in quality, despite the reviewer acknowledging that the sound effects are likely taken from the arcade version.

**Lasting Interest and Judgement:** The review notes that while the game is initially challenging, mastering the controls and tracks leads to more consistent performance.  However, the reviewer argues that the game's simulation aspects, while present, don't make it particularly engaging or interesting in the long run.  The review also points out the presence of bugs, such as the game restarting on a different track, which detracts from the overall experience.  The reviewer concludes that while the conversion to Amiga is commendable, the game's core gameplay, stripped of the arcade's feedback mechanisms, is not particularly compelling.

**Graphics, Sound, Intellect, Addiction, and Overall Scores:** The review provides a breakdown of the game's components, assigning numerical scores to graphics (8), sound (4), intellect (3), addiction (6), and an overall score of 50%.

**Screenshots and Gameplay Examples:** The page includes several screenshots of the game in action, showcasing the in-game visuals and the driver's perspective.

**Reviewer's Conclusion:** The review concludes by stating that while the conversion to Amiga is well-executed, the game's core gameplay, stripped of the arcade's feedback mechanisms, is not particularly compelling.  The reviewer suggests that the game might be better suited for arcade environments than for home computers.

**Graphics and Sound:** The review criticizes the graphics as ""blocky"" and ""simple,"" though acknowledging they are colorful.  The sound effects are described as ""grating rather than satisfying.""  The text-based AI programming interface, however, is praised for its futuristic typeface.

**Judgement:** The reviewer notes an obsessive quality to the game, suggesting it's a game that can be played for extended periods.  The reviewer also points out that the game is more cerebral than a typical shoot-em-up, appealing to players who enjoy problem-solving and puzzle elements.

The review notes that the children quickly learned to use a pre-existing procedure to draw an octagon.

* **""Getting Sophisticated""**: This section details the children's progression to more complex procedures.  They learn to use a friend's procedure that turns the turtle through degrees before redrawing the octagon, creating a repeating pattern.  The review highlights the children's ability to modify the procedure to create a two-color octagon.  The review also notes the children's exploration of color options.

* **""More with the Mouse""**: This section focuses on the use of the mouse and menus within the Amiga Logo interface.  The children learn to use file requesters, pull-down menus, and the two-button mouse.  The review mentions a demonstration drawing of a car, which the turtle draws.  The children also experiment with changing colors.

* **""Conclusion""**: This section summarizes the review.  The authors praise the software's educational value, noting its ability to encourage exploration, cooperation, and a sense of accomplishment.  They also mention a couple of minor issues, such as the program window being able to be pulled down multiple times, which caused some loading issues.
