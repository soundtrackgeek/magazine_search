The article details the importance of the player's experience with the ship's control in arcade games.  It emphasizes that the player's focus is almost entirely on the ship's movement and appearance, so any issues with the control scheme or graphics will quickly detract from the game.

The article goes on to explain the design choices made for the ship's control in a game called ""Menace.""  It discusses how different ship designs were tested before settling on one that players liked.  The core control method is described as an eight-directional movement, a common approach for scrolling shooters.

Crucially, the article highlights the implementation of inertia when controlling the ship with a mouse.  This inertia is a programming technique that prevents the ship from instantly changing direction when the mouse is moved. Instead, the ship slows down in its current direction, stops, and then accelerates in the new direction.  The article explains how this inertia is implemented in code, using snippets to illustrate the effect.  It also provides practical advice on how to adjust the speed of the ship's movement in the code.

The page also includes several visual elements, likely screenshots or mockups, of game screens showing different ships and gameplay scenarios.

87,"This page is a review of MicroIllusions' Music-X Junior, a cut-down version of their popular Music-X Amiga music software.  The review, written by Jason Holborn, appears in *Amiga Format* magazine, issue 87.

The review is structured into several sections:

**Introduction:** The review begins by highlighting Music-X's success in promoting the Amiga as a music workstation. It then notes that while the software offers a lot, its price point of Â£225 is significant.  The review then introduces the cut-down version, Music-X Junior, and its lower price point.

**Like Father, Like Son?:** This section directly compares Music-X Junior to its predecessor.  The author notes that the initial impression is of a very similar program, but closer inspection reveals significant differences.  Key changes include the removal of external synchronization options (SMPTE, etc.), the removal of most recording options (punch-in, loop, target sequence muting), and the reduction of the MIDI patchbay functionality in the Filters page.

**Detailed Feature Analysis:** The review then delves into specific features, breaking down the changes to the sequencer, filters, and keymaps pages.  The sequencer page, while retaining its core functionality, lacks SMPTE time code support. The filters page has been significantly simplified, reducing its usefulness as a MIDI patchbay. The keymaps page has also been reduced in functionality, allowing only one keymap to be active at a time.

**Sample City:** This section discusses the samples page, which has remained largely unchanged and intact from the original Music-X.  The author notes that the inclusion of up to sixteen samples per MIDI channel is a useful feature, especially when combined with a sampler like Master Sound.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is a balanced assessment of Music-X Junior. While acknowledging some shortcomings (the loss of features like SMPTE and the simplified filters), the author ultimately praises the program's value for the price.  The review emphasizes that while the original Music-X had more features, Music-X Junior provides a complete MIDI studio for under Â£100, making it a worthwhile option for amateur musicians.

**Review Rating:**  While the review doesn't explicitly assign a numerical rating, the overall tone is positive and suggests a favorable opinion of Music-X Junior.  The author highlights the value proposition of the program, despite the loss of some features.

124,"This page is a tutorial from *Amiga Format* magazine, titled ""STAND ALONE NOTEPAD.""  It details how to create a disk that will automatically boot the Notepad program on an Amiga computer.

The tutorial is presented in a step-by-step format, explaining the commands and procedures required to create a bootable Notepad disk.

**Detailed Description of the Tutorial:**

* **Introduction:** The introduction explains the desire to run Notepad directly from a disk, rather than loading it from the Workbench.
* **Formatting the Disk:** The tutorial begins by instructing the user to format a blank disk using the Workbench's CLI (Command Line Interface).  The command `Format DRIVE DF0: NAME ""NotePad"" NOICONS` is given.
* **Copying Files:**  The user is then guided through copying necessary files from the Workbench to the newly formatted disk.  Specific commands are provided, such as `MakeDir DF0:S`, `MakeDir DF0:LIBS`, and `Copy RAM:NotePadÂ£? DF0:`.  Crucially, the `<Printer Driver>` placeholder in some commands needs to be replaced with the actual printer driver filename.
* **Creating a Startup Sequence:** The tutorial explains the creation of a startup sequence file (`StartUp-Sequence`) using the Amiga's text editor (Ed).  The command `Ed DF0:S/StartUp-Sequence` is used to create a file containing the command `NotePad` to automatically launch Notepad upon boot.
* **Saving and Testing:** The user is instructed to save the startup sequence file to the disk using the `x` command in the CLI.
* **Testing the Disk:** The tutorial concludes by instructing the user to reset the Amiga with the new disk in the internal drive to test the boot process.
* **Important Note:** The tutorial mentions that the disk will only use the standard Topaz font.  If other fonts are needed, the user must create a FONTS directory and copy the required fonts to it.
