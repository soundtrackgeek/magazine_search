87,"This page is a review of MicroIllusions' Music-X Junior, a cut-down version of their popular Music-X Amiga music software.  The review, written by Jason Holborn, appears in *Amiga Format* magazine, issue 87.

The review is structured into several sections:

**Introduction:** The review begins by highlighting Music-X's success in promoting the Amiga as a music workstation. It then notes that while the software offers a lot, its price point of £225 is significant.  The review then introduces the cut-down version, Music-X Junior, and its lower price point.

**Like Father, Like Son?:** This section directly compares Music-X Junior to its predecessor.  The author notes that the initial impression is of a very similar program, but closer inspection reveals significant differences.  Key changes include the removal of external synchronization options (SMPTE, etc.), the removal of most recording options (punch-in, loop, target sequence muting), and the reduction of the MIDI patchbay functionality in the Filters page.

**Detailed Feature Analysis:** The review then delves into specific features, breaking down the changes to the sequencer, filters, and keymaps pages.  The sequencer page, while retaining its core functionality, lacks SMPTE time code support. The filters page has been significantly simplified, reducing its usefulness as a MIDI patchbay. The keymaps page has also been reduced in functionality, allowing only one keymap to be active at a time.

**Sample City:** This section discusses the samples page, which has remained largely unchanged and intact from the original Music-X.  The author notes that the inclusion of up to sixteen samples per MIDI channel is a useful feature, especially when combined with a sampler like Master Sound.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is a balanced assessment of Music-X Junior. While acknowledging some shortcomings (the loss of features like SMPTE and the simplified filters), the author ultimately praises the program's value for the price.  The review emphasizes that while the original Music-X had more features, Music-X Junior provides a complete MIDI studio for under £100, making it a worthwhile option for amateur musicians.

**Review Rating:**  While the review doesn't explicitly assign a numerical rating, the overall tone is positive and suggests a favorable opinion of Music-X Junior.  The author highlights the value proposition of the program, despite the loss of some features.


**Technical Specifications:** The page also includes technical specifications for Music-X Junior, including its price and availability.

124,"This page is a tutorial from *Amiga Format* magazine, titled ""STAND ALONE NOTEPAD.""  It details how to create a disk that will automatically boot the Notepad program on an Amiga computer.

The tutorial is presented in a step-by-step format, explaining the commands and procedures required to create a bootable Notepad disk.

**Detailed Description of the Tutorial:**

* **Introduction:** The introduction explains the desire to run Notepad directly from a disk, rather than loading it from the Workbench.
* **Formatting the Disk:** The tutorial begins by instructing the user to format a blank disk using the Workbench's CLI (Command Line Interface).  The command `Format DRIVE DF0: NAME ""NotePad"" NOICONS` is given.
* **Copying Files:**  The user is then guided through copying necessary files from the Workbench to the newly formatted disk.  Specific commands are provided, such as `MakeDir DF0:S`, `MakeDir DF0:LIBS`, and `Copy RAM:NotePad£? DF0:`.  Crucially, the `<Printer Driver>` placeholder in some commands needs to be replaced with the actual printer driver filename.
* **Creating a Startup Sequence:** The tutorial explains the creation of a startup sequence file (`StartUp-Sequence`) using the Amiga's text editor (Ed).  The command `Ed DF0:S/StartUp-Sequence` is used to create a file containing the command `NotePad` to automatically launch Notepad upon boot.
* **Saving and Testing:** The user is instructed to save the startup sequence file to the disk using the `x` command in the CLI.
* **Testing the Disk:** The tutorial concludes by instructing the user to reset the Amiga with the new disk in the internal drive to test the boot process.
* **Important Note:** The tutorial mentions that the disk will only use the standard Topaz font.  If other fonts are needed, the user must create a FONTS directory and copy the required fonts to it.

**Additional Section:**

* **""Everything Counts!"":** This section is a separate feature within the magazine, encouraging readers to submit tips and tricks for other Amiga users.  It offers a reward of £50 for the best tip of the month.  It also solicits tips for various software packages, including DPaint, Music-X, Aegis Sonix, and Professional Page.
