It emphasizes that the program doesn't require external MIDI devices, allowing users to play back and swap four samples simultaneously.  The author notes that this makes it a good starting point for those new to MIDI.  The review also mentions that the program doesn't include an interface for MIDI, but that this isn't a significant drawback.

**FROM EASY TO ADVANCED Section:**

This section dives deeper into the program's features and functionality.  It describes two key editors:

* **Event Editor:** This editor presents MIDI data as a stream, allowing for detailed control over individual events.  The author notes that the program synchronizes with various clocks, including internal video clocks and SMPTE, and that it can handle different timing codes.  The review also mentions that the program can copy, merge, over-record, and extract certain types of events.

* **Bar Editor:** This editor provides a simpler, but less precise, graphical representation of the music.  Notes are represented by colored oblongs, and vertical bars indicate velocity and aftertouch.  The entire display scrolls from left to right, and a piano keyboard is included for pitch reference.  The author notes that while the graphics are useful, editing by ear is often more effective.

The review also mentions the program's manual, which is described as comprehensive for beginners but lacking in detail for advanced users.  The author also notes the program's ability to handle different MIDI channels and timing codes.

**Overall:**

The review seems positive, highlighting the program's ease of use for beginners and its advanced features for more experienced users.
