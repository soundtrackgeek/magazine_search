The reviewer also notes that the game's impressive visuals are undermined by the small screen size.

* **""But"" (Further Critique):** This section expands on the previous criticisms, emphasizing that the game's options are not worth using unless you have a high-end Amiga.  The reviewer states that two-thirds of the viewing angles are unusable, and the game prioritizes showing off its capabilities over providing a good experience.

""Floating City"" is criticized for its lack of city-like features, while ""Road Circuit"" is criticized for its ""queasy spinning"" 3D graphics.  ""Tropical Islands"" is described as having a gimmick, but the reviewer notes the shallow water makes the level less impressive.

* **Additional Notes:** The page includes some humorous asides, such as the suggestion that the sun roof should be renamed ""let-the-rain-in roof"" and a comment about girls not understanding football.  These add a lighthearted touch to the otherwise critical review.

**Overall:** The review paints a picture of a game with potential but significant flaws.  While the mechanics are praised, the gameplay experience is marred by sluggish controls, poor camera angles, and a small screen that diminishes the game's visual appeal.  The reviewer concludes that the game's strengths are overshadowed by its weaknesses.

30,"This page is a review of the video game ""Extreme Racing"" for the Amiga computer, from Amiga Power magazine, February 1996.

The review, titled ""Fiddling,"" is written by Dave Golder.  The review gives a mixed assessment of the game.

**Review Summary:**

The reviewer, while acknowledging some technical merits (especially the expanded A1200 version), ultimately finds the game underwhelming.  The core gameplay is described as lacking excitement and character, with repetitive tracks and uninspired vehicles.  The controls are criticized as not being responsive or intuitive.  The graphics, while not terrible, are not a standout feature.  The reviewer also notes the game's disappointing weaponry and the lack of a compelling atmosphere.  The multiplayer mode is similarly criticized as uninspired.

**Rating:**

The review gives the game a score of 59% overall.

**Other Sections:**

This section is a lighthearted commentary on the game's design choices.

* **Expanded/Unexpanded A1200 Owners**: This section further breaks down the review by considering the experience of players with different Amiga A1200 configurations.  It highlights the superior graphics and options available to those with expanded A1200 systems, contrasting them with the less impressive experience on standard A1200s.  The reviewer notes that even with the expanded options, the game still falls short of expectations.

* **The Bottom Line**: This is a concise summary of the review's overall conclusion.  The reviewer reiterates the game's competent but ultimately unexceptional nature, particularly in comparison to other racing games.

* **Reviewer Comments**:  The page includes a few additional comments from the reviewer, including a humorous anecdote about the difficulty of finding options in the game's menus.

In conclusion, the review paints a picture of a game that, while technically functional, lacks the charm, excitement, and depth that would make it a truly memorable racing experience.  The reviewer's overall impression is that the game is more of a technical exercise than a truly engaging or enjoyable experience.

**Sabre Team Review:**

* **Rating:**  The review gives a score of 51%
