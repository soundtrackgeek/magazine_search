However, they criticize the repetitive level design, noting that the eight levels are nearly identical in difficulty and feel.  The reviewer also points out the artificiality of the difficulty increase, which only comes from adding more enemies or rockets to destroy, rather than a genuine increase in challenge.  The short-term addictive nature of the game quickly gives way to boredom.  The reviewer also notes the extremely tight time limits on each level as a negative aspect of the game design.

* **Presentation:** The reviewer finds the graphics ""alright"" in some parts, particularly the animation during climbing and swinging, but criticizes the graphics as ""dire"" in other areas, like running.  The background art is described as fairly atmospheric but formulaic.  The music and sound effects are deemed useless and perfunctory.  The presentation is further criticized for the lack of a satisfying ""well done"" message or meaningful ending after completing a level.

* **Scenario and Presentation:** The reviewer comments on the game's scenario, noting the somewhat forced tie-in with the movie, and the lack of a compelling presentation.  The reviewer finds the game's presentation to be somewhat schizophrenic, with a strange mix of introductory screens and a lack of meaningful feedback after completing levels.

* **Overall Impression:** The review concludes that the game, despite being a long-awaited title, is ultimately ""playable but extremely average in most respects.""  The reviewer questions the effort put into the game's development, given its lack of significant improvements over other similar games.

It points out that the latter approach can be problematic if the film's plot or action sequences don't easily translate into a single game format.

* **How Important Is Character?:**  This section emphasizes the importance of accurately representing the film's characters, arguing that a strong character presence is crucial for player engagement and connection to the source material.

The game involves participating in events surrounding the development of a working SDI system by the US military, with the help of the CIA, FBI, and in competition with the KGB.

**Gunboat Review:**

The review gives a detailed look at the gameplay mechanics of ""Gunboat,"" highlighting its unusual simulation nature.  It's compared to other types of games like flight simulators and tank simulators, but emphasizes its focus on American River Patrol Boats (PBRs) in various locations like Vietnam, Colombia, and the Panama Canal.  The reviewer notes the scenarios form a loose plot, with missions progressing as the player gains experience.  A key feature is the ability to practice in different gun positions and control the vessel.  The review also mentions the pre-mission settings, including detail level, steering rate, and weapon choices.  The reviewer discusses the 3D polygon graphics, noting a ""blocky detail"" style that's both unusual and effective.  The review also touches on the difficulty of night combat and the use of searchlights.  The reviewer notes the combination of 3D graphics and blocky detail as a unique aspect of the game.  The review also mentions the game's control scheme and the need to familiarize oneself with the various pieces of equipment.  The review concludes with a mixed opinion, praising the originality and style of the game but suggesting that flight games might be a better choice for those unfamiliar with simulations.  The review gives the game a 71% rating.

**Afrika Korps Review:**

The review of ""Afrika Korps"" describes it as a war game simulating the Western Desert Campaign of World War II, pitting the Afrika Korps against the British Eighth Army.  The reviewer notes the traditional gameplay of choosing a side and attempting to defeat the other.  The game's scenario-based approach is highlighted, with the reviewer emphasizing the importance of the scenario set.  The review also mentions the game's sequel status to ""Blitzkrieg,"" and the improvements made in terms of artificial intelligence.  The reviewer notes the game's use of a map interface and the presence of various units and vehicles.  The review also touches on the game's graphics, describing them as ""cuddly"" and ""scrollable,"" and the use of a 16-bit interface.  The review criticizes the game's gameplay, stating that it doesn't offer significant new features compared to other war games.  The reviewer also notes the game's use of a Spectrum-like interface and the lack of significant improvements in gameplay.  The review concludes with a negative assessment, suggesting that the game's originality and gameplay are not particularly compelling.

79,"This page contains two game reviews, one for ""Cohort"" and one for ""Renegade Legion Interceptor.""  Both are from Amiga Power magazine, August 1991.

**COHORT Review:**

* **Rating:** 40% (out of 100)
* **Review Summary:** The review describes ""Cohort"" as a wargame set in ancient Rome.  While the graphics are praised as ""outstanding,"" the gameplay is deemed ""dull"" and ""unimpressive.""  The reviewer criticizes the complexity of the game's controls and the repetitive nature of the battles.  The reviewer also notes some minor technical issues, such as odd cavalry sound effects when no horses are present.  The bottom line is that the game is a ""fine off-beat battle sim,"" but not worth the price.

**RENEGADE LEGION INTERCEPTOR Review:**

* **Rating:** 39% (out of 100)
* **Review Summary:** This review is highly critical of ""Renegade Legion Interceptor,"" calling it ""useless."" The reviewer points out a severe lack of action and a tedious process of selecting pilots, ships, and weapons before any actual gameplay begins.  The reviewer finds the combat sequences ""ugly and easy"" and the enemy AI ""amazingly stupid.""  The reviewer concludes that while the game has impressive sci-fi hardware, there's little opportunity to use it effectively.  The bottom line is that the game is a waste of time, especially for those who aren't interested in the technical details of space ships.

The page also includes screenshots of both games, showing the game's graphics and interface.  There are also details about the game's publisher, authors, price, and release date for each game.
