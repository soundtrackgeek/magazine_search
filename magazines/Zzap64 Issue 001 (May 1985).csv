20,"This page is a review of a video game, likely from a magazine, focusing on two games: ""Pastfinder"" and ""Styler"".

**Pastfinder Review:**

The review describes ""Pastfinder"" as a 3D shoot-'em-up with unusual graphics, playable with a joystick.  It's noted as having a large map to explore with leaping and rotating craft.  The reviewer finds the game initially similar to other shoot-'em-ups but quickly reveals more complex tactics and skill-based gameplay.  The control method is described as adding a new dimension, though it takes time to master.  The reviewer praises the spaceship animation and maneuverability once mastered.  The reviewer also mentions the game's background colors as somewhat harsh on the eyes.  The sound is criticized as being simple, reminiscent of the Space Invaders sound.  The reviewer concludes that the game is a worthy addition to the Activision range.  The review includes a price and platform information (£9.99 cassette, £19.99 disk, joystick only).

**Styler Review:**

The review for ""Styler"" focuses on the game's control and landscape.  The reviewer notes the unusual movement of the spacecraft, comparing it to a footless frog.  The control is described as requiring a bit of getting used to, with joystick up causing acceleration and leaping.  The landscape is praised for its detailed, crisp, and colorful graphics, with clear shadows to help gauge obstacles.  The reviewer notes that the game becomes more challenging with moving spikes, expanding walls, and rising towers.  The sound is again criticized, this time as being very disappointing, reduced to a simple Space Invaders-style heartbeat and beeps.  The review also mentions a scoring system and a playing status that increases as the player collects artifacts.

There's a small section about the game map, highlighting areas of high and low radiation.  The page also includes a section on the controls for the ""Leeper"" spacecraft, emphasizing the importance of precise timing for the leaping movement.

22,"This page is a review of the arcade game ""Rock 'n' Bolt,"" published by Activision.  The review, likely from a magazine like *ZZAP! 64*, is from May 1985.

The review is presented in a multi-part format, with different sections focusing on various aspects of the game.

**Overall Review and Initial Impressions:**

The reviewer, J.R., initially had high hopes for the game, comparing it to another Activision title, ""Zenji."" However, the review quickly turns critical, stating that the game's appeal ""died exponentially with play.""  The reviewer found the game ultimately not engaging enough to warrant hours of play.

**Gameplay Description:**

The reviewer describes the game as a puzzle-style arcade game, combining quick thinking and control with a strategic approach.  It's likened to a 2D Rubik's Cube, with sliding pieces.  The player controls a character (Louie) who must bolt down girders within a time limit.  The game progresses through levels, and the time limit increases as the levels progress.  The player must carefully plan their route to ensure they don't isolate themselves and can return to the starting point.  There are three difficulty levels (practice, easy, and hard).  The game features two different screen types, with the first requiring the player to bolt everything down and return to a lift, and the second requiring the player to follow a specific blueprint.

**Technical Aspects:**

The reviewer notes the game's slick graphics and superb music. However, they criticize the lack of challenge and increasing boredom factor.  The time limit is the only element that keeps the player engaged, but even that can become monotonous.  The reviewer also points out the abrupt switching between screens, rather than scrolling.

**Presentation and Originality:**

The review breaks down the game's presentation into categories, rating each aspect on a percentage scale.  The reviewer gives the following ratings:

* **Presentation (75%):**  Positive for the choice of level, time allowance, and 1 or 2 player options.
* **Graphics (74%):**  The graphics are described as ""Louie bops and spins beautifully, otherwise plain.""
* **Sound (93%):**  The reviewer praises the ""seven fantastic foot-tapping funky tunes.""
* **Originality (76%):**  The reviewer notes that bolting down girders is a new concept.
* **Hookability (81%):**  The reviewer states an immediate desire to complete the layout.
* **Lastability (67%):**  The reviewer notes 100 screens, but many are easy.
* **Value for Money (61%):**  The game is considered expensive, but almost a good game, but not quite enough variety.

**Overall Impression:**

The review concludes that while the game has some positive aspects, such as the music and animation, it ultimately lacks the challenge and variety to keep players engaged for extended periods.  The reviewer finds the game ""somewhat flawed"" and ""fades"" after an initial interest.

**Game Overview:** The review begins with a description of the game's premise, highlighting the unusual gameplay mechanic of characters vanishing from one location and reappearing elsewhere.  The reviewer notes the game's intended genre as a fully animated graphic adventure.

**Gameplay Analysis:** The reviewer details the gameplay mechanics, including the use of a joystick for exploration and a menu-driven system for actions.  They mention the presence of 64 locations, 3 skill levels, and a map that's visually appealing but the graphics and animation of the game itself are considered crude.  The sound effects are also criticized as unimpressive.  The reviewer also points out the difficulty of combining joystick movement with keyboard-based actions, especially in combat.  The game's ""Shades"" mechanic, which randomly transports the player to earlier locations, is described as frustrating.  The reviewer also notes the presence of monsters, traps, and items to collect.

**Review Sections:** The review is broken down into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the game:

* **Presentation (69%):** The reviewer finds the instructions to be exciting.
* **Graphics (42%):**  The sprites are considered nice, but the locations and animation are deemed poor.
* **Sound (35%):** The sound effects are described as occasional buzzes and hums.
* **Value for Money (37%):** The reviewer concludes that the game doesn't offer enough arcade or adventure elements to be satisfying.
* **Originality (64%):** The reviewer acknowledges the game's commendable concept but notes that it's not entirely original.
* **Hookability (24%):** The reviewer states that it will take a long time to get into the game.
* **Lastability (48%):** The reviewer finds the 64 locations to be a plus, suggesting plenty of content.

**Overall Impression:** The reviewer's overall impression is mixed. While the concept is commendable, the execution, particularly in terms of graphics, sound, and gameplay flow, falls short.  The reviewer highlights the frustration caused by the random ""Shades"" mechanic and the difficulty of combining joystick and keyboard controls.  The review concludes that the game is unlikely to appeal to a broad audience, unless they are fans of the Valhalla-style adventure games.

**Additional Notes:** The page also includes a small advertisement for the game, highlighting its 3D graphics and requirement for a joystick.  A separate section from a different reviewer (GP) also provides a different perspective on the game, emphasizing the slow animation and the difficulty of the combat.  The review also includes a quote from the programmer.

**Ripper Review:**

The review of ""Ripper,"" published by Eclipse Software, is critical.  The reviewer describes the game as having a ""ghoulish"" atmosphere, but the location descriptions are short and the game suffers from significant delays in processing player input.  The reviewer notes that the delays are likely due to disk access, and that the game's sparse presentation would be even worse on a tape-based system.  The reviewer concludes that the atmosphere is the only redeeming quality, and that the £12.95 price is not justified given the game's shortcomings.  The review gives the game a low score across various categories (Atmosphere 65%, Interaction 50%, Lasting Interest 58%, Value for Money 50%).

The reviewer highlights the complex input commands, such as ""Give the money to the bartender,"" and the ability to issue multiple directions (e.g., N.N.N.E.).  The ""sneak preview"" mode is described as a good way to advertise the other game in the series.  The reviewer also notes that the game format is striking and colorful, with large illustrations for each location and a small text window.  The reviewer praises the professional look of the graphics, though some might disagree on the characterization.  ""Mindshadow"" is described as a logical game where the player explores locations to discover their identity and purpose.  The game has approximately 80 locations and puzzles.  The reviewer notes that the game has no ""stupid"" routines, such as a rock falling and killing the player.  The reviewer highlights the ""Think about..."" feature, which can provide insights into problems.  The review also mentions the option to ask for help.

The review gives ""Mindshadow"" a higher score (Atmosphere 70%, Interaction 70%, Lasting Interest 68%, Value for Money 60%).  The review for ""The Tracer Sanction"" is similar, but with slightly lower scores (Atmosphere 55%, Interaction 70%, Lasting Interest 65%, Value for Money 60%).

The reviewer emphasizes the program's ability to handle various musical notations, including rests, sharps, flats, and different instrument choices.

The review also notes the program's intuitive design, with clear on-screen instructions and visual representations of actions.  The reviewer finds the program's ability to save music on tape or disk to be a valuable feature.

The review concludes with a rating system, giving the program high marks across several categories: Presentation (93%), Ease of Use (91%), Sound Potential (88%), and Value for Money (85%).

120,"This page is an article from Zzap! 64 magazine, dated May 1985.  It's a column by Jeff Minter, a columnist known for his ""Hairy, freaky, hilarious, unorthodox, irreverent, controversial"" style.  The article focuses on the computer game industry, specifically on the issues of piracy, distribution, and the overall state of software.

The article is divided into several sections, each addressing a different aspect of the problem:

**1. Introduction and Greeting:** The column begins with a greeting to readers and a brief introduction of Jeff Minter as a games creator and columnist.  He sets the tone for the article by highlighting his unique perspective as both a game developer and a player.

**2. Piracy and Copying:** Minter discusses the issue of piracy, arguing that while commercial piracy is a problem, the casual copying among friends is less harmful.  He emphasizes that the real problem lies in the lack of respect for intellectual property, and the frustration of seeing good games not recognized or appreciated.

**3. The Importance of Individual Style:**  Minter advocates for software houses to develop a distinctive style for their games.  He argues that this is crucial for recognition and that games should stand out from the crowd.  He uses his own experience as an example, highlighting the importance of a unique style in his games.

**4. Distributor Issues:**  This section is the core of the article.  Minter criticizes the distributors, arguing that they are often more interested in hype and profit than in promoting truly innovative games.  He uses his own experience with his game *Ancipital* as a case study, highlighting how the game was well-received but not distributed effectively.  He argues that chain stores are not the right medium for selling computer software and that distributors should be more open to new and different games.

**5. Solutions and Recommendations:** Minter offers solutions to the problems he identifies.  He suggests that gamers should buy from specialist computer shops, and that they should contact distributors directly to express their opinions and preferences.  He also encourages software houses to develop a unique style and consider mail-order options.

**6. Conclusion:** The article concludes with a call to action, urging readers to support innovative games and to challenge the status quo in the industry.  The final section includes a humorous, self-referential closing statement from the author.

**Overall Tone and Rating:** The article is critical of the computer game industry's distribution practices and the lack of support for innovative games.

The article is clearly opinionated and aimed at engaging the reader in a discussion about the industry's issues.
