The reviewer suggests that the game's performance could be significantly improved by optimizing the disk access and loading times.

The review, which takes up a significant portion of the page, gives the game a rating of 73 out of 100.  The reviewer, Neil West, describes the game as a combination of a Golden Axe-style beat-'em-up and traditional role-playing elements.  The review is critical, noting that while the visuals and sound effects are good, the game lacks depth in several areas.  Specifically, the reviewer points out:

* **Awkward disk access:** The reviewer mentions that awkward disk accessing breaks the flow of the game.
* **Limited detail and sophistication:** The game lacks detail and sophistication in its overall design.  There isn't enough depth to the RPG elements or the hack-and-slash sequences.
* **Mediocre game hidden beneath glossy presentation:** The reviewer feels the game's presentation is misleading, as the game itself is not as good as it appears.

Despite these criticisms, the reviewer acknowledges some positive aspects:

* **Good atmosphere:** The game's intro sequence and overall atmosphere are well-done.
* **Engaging visuals and sound:** The visuals and sound effects create a believable and spooky game world.
* **Four-player option:** The four-player option adds a sense of urgency and potentially great fun.
