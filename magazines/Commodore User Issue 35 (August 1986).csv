90,"This page is a review of the Timeworks 128 business software suite, specifically focusing on the four programs: Word Writer, Swiftcalc, Data Manager, and Sideways.

The review begins with an introductory paragraph highlighting the availability of the software in the UK market and its customisation for the UK market.  It emphasizes that the four programs combine to create a cost-effective system.

A section titled ""Timeworks 128 Business Software reviewed"" details the individual programs.  It mentions that Word Writer includes an 85,000-word dictionary spelling checker and a built-in report writer.  The review notes that data from one program can be used in another, creating an integrated system.  The review also points out the programs' compatibility with the 80-column screen and the availability of the programs separately.  The price of each program is mentioned, with a lower price for Sideways.  The review also praises the user-friendly interface, including windows and pull-down menus, and the helpful on-screen help.  It also mentions the well-organized manuals and the availability of example files and a helpline.

A separate section focuses on Word Writer, describing its features in detail.  The review highlights the spell-checker's value, highlighting, underlining, and italics capabilities, and the full word-wrap feature.  It also mentions the ability to set page width wider than the screen, allowing for scrolling.

"
91,"This page is a review of a suite of software programs, likely for a 128-based computer system.  The review, written by Chris Durham, details his experience with Swiftcalc, Data Manager, and Sideways, three programs in the suite.

**Swiftcalc:**  The review describes Swiftcalc as one of the best spreadsheets for the 128, praising its 250 rows and columns, extensive mathematical functions (including trigonometry, logarithms, and complex IF/THEN/ELSE statements), and annuity/investment calculation commands.  It highlights the ability to freeze cells, lock cells to prevent accidental changes, and the ""Quick Entry"" system for headings.  The reviewer also mentions the ""Super Graphics"" module for creating various chart types (3D bar charts, scatter diagrams, line graphs, and exploded pie charts) that can be displayed on screen and printed.

**Data Manager:**  This program is considered the weakest of the three.  While the record creation facilities are good and use similar control methods to the other programs, the reviewer points out several niggling problems.  These include issues with the printer functions (requiring the user to specify ASCII, linefeeds, etc., every time), and the report generation capabilities.  The graphical options are also deemed inferior to Swiftcalc's.

**Sideways:**  Sideways is described as ideal for creating wide spreadsheets that don't fit on a single page.  It rotates the spreadsheet 90 degrees to print vertically, eliminating the need to split the spreadsheet across multiple pages.  The reviewer notes that it works with other commercial spreadsheets that use ASCII data files, but Swiftcalc's own version doesn't work with other programs.

**Summary:** The review concludes that the programs are simple and easy to use, which will appeal to a wide range of users.  While there are better programs available, the suite is considered good value for the price of £172.50.  The review also lists the prices for each program in the suite: Swiftcalc (£57.50), Data Manager (£57.50), Sideways (£54.40), and Word Writer (£57.50).  Contact information for Timeworks (UK) Ltd. is also provided.

**Overall:** The review is a detailed assessment of the software's strengths and weaknesses, providing specific examples and suggestions for use.  The review rating isn't explicitly stated as a numerical score, but the overall tone suggests a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, assessment of the software suite.

"
93,"This page is a continuation of a tutorial or guide on using Superbase, a database program.  It's part two of a series, focusing on problem-solving and frequently asked questions.

**Section 1: Copying a Superbase Database**

The first section addresses the issue of why a standard ""copy all"" utility doesn't work with Superbase databases.  It explains that Superbase data is structured differently than other files, storing it in a compact format with a dedicated record directory for fast access.  The author emphasizes that a direct copy will fail because it doesn't replicate the directory structure correctly.  A workaround is suggested: copying the data to another disk and then importing it.

**Section 2: Fixing File Format Changes**

This section deals with issues arising from modifying a Superbase file's format.  The author explains that if you add or delete fields in the middle of a file, the data associated with those fields becomes mismatched.  Three solutions are provided:

1. **Reverting to the previous format:** If the format change is recent, reverting to the previous format and deleting records added since the change is a solution.
2. **Small files:** For small files, changing all field types to text, fixing the problematic records, and then reverting the field types is recommended.
3. **Large files:** For large files, the author recommends exporting the data, recreating the database, and importing the data.

**Section 3: Page Numbering in Reports**

This section provides a code example for automatically numbering pages in reports generated by Superbase.  The code snippet demonstrates how to use variables like `PN` (page number), `P1` (page length), and `H` (total lines) to dynamically insert page numbers into the report.

**Section 4: Handling ""Disk Full"" Errors**

This section addresses the ""disk full"" error message.  The author recommends backing up the master disk and using a backup as the master disk.  Crucially, they advise against writing to the disk that caused the error.  For Superbase Version 2, the utility program can recover and copy the database to a new disk.  For Version 1, the author suggests using the ""output to"" command to extract data in small chunks and copy it to another disk.

**Overall:**

The page is a practical guide, offering solutions to common problems encountered when using Superbase.  The tone is helpful and provides specific examples and code snippets to aid users in troubleshooting and optimizing their database management.  The page doesn't explicitly state a review rating, but the content suggests a helpful and informative guide.

* **Wrong address:** A reader describes a problem where entering a value into a memory address (POKE) and then reading it back (PEEK) yields a different value.  The problem seems to be confined to a specific range of addresses (53266 to 65535). The response suggests that some memory locations are ""write-only"" and that resetting the computer won't solve the issue.

* **220V Transformer:** A reader asks if a 240V transformer will work with a 220V computer. The response explains that most modern equipment is designed for a wide range of voltage tolerances, and that the slight difference in voltage is handled by internal regulators.  However, there's a caveat about checking for a 240V input tap on the transformer if the computer is out of warranty.

* **Sprite Mover:** A reader seeks help with moving sprites on a Commodore 128. The issue is that sprites don't move correctly and revert to block shapes when loaded from tape. The response suggests using the MOVSPR command to control sprite movement and saving/loading sprite data correctly.

* **Digital Display:** A reader describes a problem with displaying a stopwatch on a Plus/4. The issue is that digits don't appear in the same place as the previous digit. The response suggests using the CHAR command to position strings on the screen.

* **Beep Routine:** A reader has a VAT accounting program that beeps unnecessarily. The response suggests checking the input invoice totals and correcting any errors before saving.

**Section 2: Beep Routine**

This section details a reader's VAT accounting program that beeps when the input is correct. The response suggests that the routine should print the data instead of beeping.

**Section 3: Sprite Mover**

This section details a reader's problem with moving sprites on a Commodore 128. The response suggests using the MOVSPR command to control sprite movement and saving/loading sprite data correctly.

**Section 4: Digital Display**
