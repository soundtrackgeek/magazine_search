48,"This page is a review of the video game ""Fire and Forget"" for the Amiga computer system.

**Game Overview:**

The review describes ""Fire and Forget"" as a 16-bit game, inspired by the arcade game ""Roadblasters.""  It involves a player controlling a heavily armed vehicle, the ""Thunder Master,"" navigating various combat zones across the globe.  The player's goal is to defeat the Intergalactic Liberation Organization (ILO) and prevent a nuclear war.  The game features a map selection screen and different combat zones.  The player faces obstacles like mines, blockades, tanks, and helicopter attacks.  Fuel is a limited resource, and collisions with obstacles or enemy fire deplete it.  The game also includes a two-player option where a second player controls a smaller aircraft, the ""Thunder Cloud,"" to fend off enemy aircraft.

**Review Content:**

The review expresses a mixed opinion. While the concept of the game, based on its arcade predecessor, sounds promising, the actual implementation falls short.  The reviewer criticizes the following aspects:

* **Graphics:** The graphics are described as ""no great shakes,"" with road movement only ""moderately effective"" and frame updates on approaching objects not smooth.  The reviewer notes that the game relies on speed to hide its graphical deficiencies.
* **Enemy Craft Speed:** The speed at which enemy vehicles appear is deemed ""ludicrous,"" making it difficult to avoid them.  The reviewer states that the player essentially has to ""fire and forget,"" meaning they have little hope of avoiding all oncoming objects.
* **Overall Appeal:**  While the concept of the game, as described on paper, seems fun, the reality is less appealing.  The amount of obstacles to avoid and the speed of the enemy craft make the game less enjoyable.

**Technical Specifications (from the review):**

* **Price:** £9.99
* **Developer:** Titus Entertainment International

**Rating:**

The game receives a CU Rating of 5 out of 10.  This indicates a below-average rating.
