80,"This page is a letter to the editor, likely from a reader of a magazine called ZZAP!, and includes a section of reader reviews.

**The Most Boring Letter We've Ever Received:**

The letter, addressed to ""Dear Lloyd,"" is a critique of the software industry. The author, clearly frustrated, expresses disappointment with the quality of video game conversions and original releases.  They complain about:

* **Conversions:**  The author feels that many conversions of popular arcade games are poorly done, lacking originality and often rushed.  They question the motivation of programmers and software houses to create truly unique games, instead of simply replicating existing titles.  They suggest that the desire for arcade-style games on home computers is leading to disappointing results.
* **Clones:** The author criticizes the prevalence of cloned games, arguing that these often lack the quality of the original. They feel that software houses prioritize profit over quality in these conversions.
* **Graphics:** The author criticizes the low quality of graphics in many games, contrasting them with the high quality of graphics in some other titles. They feel that software houses don't put enough effort into the visual aspects of their games.
* **Multiloads:** The author questions the use of multiloads in games, arguing that they can lead to long loading times and frustration for players.
* **Tapes and Disks:** The author questions the pricing of games on disks compared to tapes, arguing that disks are often overpriced. They suggest that making disks as affordable as tapes would increase sales.
* **Tips and Pokes:** The author criticizes the tips pages in the magazine, arguing that they are often geared towards tape users and that modern users already know how to reset their computers.

**Reviews Section:**

The author also includes a section on the magazine's reviews.  They are critical of the reviews, noting:

* **Inconsistencies:** The author points out significant differences in review scores for the same game across different magazines (ZZAP!, CU, and C&VG).  They feel that the reviews are not consistent and may be influenced by subjective opinions rather than objective criteria.
* **Emphasis on Atmosphere:** The author criticizes the reviewers for sometimes prioritizing atmosphere over other aspects of a game, such as sound quality.
* **Subjectivity:** The author highlights the subjective nature of game reviews, suggesting that the best way to judge reviews is by considering the comments and playing the games themselves.

**Last Chapter:**

This section is a continuation of the author's complaints, focusing on:

* **Racing Games:** The author questions the lack of good racing games in recent years, suggesting that programmers may be avoiding the challenge of creating smooth 3D scrolling games with large graphics.
* **Software Houses:** The author criticizes specific software houses, including Ocean, for the quality of their games and the perceived lack of care for their customers.  They mention Rob Hubbard's departure from a company and express a desire for more information about his current work.
