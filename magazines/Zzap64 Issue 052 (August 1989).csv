While the background graphics aren't considered spectacular, the fast-paced, atmospheric gameplay, with plenty of enemies, makes up for it.  The reviewer also notes the game's good sound effects, particularly the ""admirable"" sonic accompaniment, although some sound effects are deemed to fade into insignificance.  The reviewer concludes that the game is a worthy re-release, living up to the ""cheapie"" label.

**Ninja Commando Zeppelin Review:**

The review for *Ninja Commando Zeppelin* gives it an overall rating of 69%.  The reviewer describes the game as ""fun,"" highlighting the use of nunchucks, shurikens, and other weapons.  The gameplay is described as challenging, with the difficulty level possibly being a bit high.

58,"This page is a section from a magazine, likely a video game review section, from Zzap! magazine, August 1989.  It features reviews of two arcade games: ""Arcade Flight Simulator"" and ""Saboteur II"" and ""Deep Strike"".

**Arcade Flight Simulator:**

* **Rating:**  41%
* **Description:** The review criticizes the game's sound effects, sprites, and overall presentation, calling it a step back from earlier jet games on the Atari console.  The reviewer notes the game's attempt to create a more engaging experience with wrap-around screens and ground objects, but ultimately finds the execution lacking.  The game is played across three different time periods (WWI, WWII, and the 1990s), with the player controlling different aircraft. The goal is to destroy enemy bases.

**Saboteur II:**

* **Rating:** 52%
* **Description:** The review describes ""Saboteur II"" as a game that feels very similar to its predecessor, ""Saboteur.""  The reviewer notes that the graphics and gameplay are very similar, with only the sound effects being a minor improvement.  The game involves breaking into a warehouse, changing missile instructions, and avoiding robot guards with flamethrowers.  The reviewer mentions the game's repetitive nature and the feeling of being ""conned"" if you already own the original.

**Deep Strike:**

* **Rating:** 61%
* **Description:** The review for ""Deep Strike"" is more positive, praising the game's presentation (fast, 3D graphics, and a tuneful soundtrack). However, the reviewer also points out a significant drawback: the overwhelming number of attackers who seem to target the player simultaneously.  The reviewer suggests a strategy might exist to overcome this, but couldn't find it.  The game is played from a cockpit perspective, with a 3D view of the ground.  The player controls a bomber and must attack enemy targets.
