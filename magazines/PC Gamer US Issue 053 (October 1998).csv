However, the review also notes that the game's artificial intelligence (AI) can sometimes be flawed, occasionally overwhelming the player with too many tasks.  The reviewer highlights the game's impressive graphics, particularly the explosions and rendering effects.

**Specific Details:**

* **Category:** Action/Strategy
* **Developer:** TerraTools
* **Publisher:** Microsoft
* **Required System Specs:** Windows 95, Quad-speed CD-ROM drive, Pentium 133, 16MB RAM, 100MB hard drive space, Windows compatible sound card, and mouse.  Recommended specs include a Pentium II, 32MB RAM, 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics-based accelerator, joystick, throttle, and rudders.
* **Multiplayer:** Supports Serial/Null-modem, Modem: 28.8, IPX, TCP/IP, and a maximum of 4 players.  Free Internet Service is available at www.zone.com.
* **Gameplay Overview:** The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where players must control a base (Host Station) and manage resources to survive.

Missions involve controlling territories, upgrading technology, and using various units (drones, tanks, choppers, and planes).  The game features a squad menu that allows for easy unit grouping and command.

201,"This page is a review of the video game ""Urban Assault,"" published in PC Gamer magazine in October 1998.  The review is lengthy, providing a detailed analysis of the game's strengths and weaknesses.

**Review Rating:** 80%

**Review Content:**

The review begins with a detailed description of the game's gameplay mechanics, focusing on the action mode, controls, and physics model.  The reviewer notes that while the vehicle controls and action mode are generally satisfactory, the controls feel somewhat sluggish and the sense of motion isn't entirely convincing.  The damage model is also described as unusual, with vehicles taking surprising amounts of damage in certain situations.

The reviewer then points out a significant issue: the difficulty of controlling units effectively.  The game's AI is described as only average, and units under human control are exceptionally powerful, making it easy to overwhelm enemies with a well-placed force.  The reviewer also criticizes the game's susceptibility to the ""base rush"" tactic, where quickly overwhelming the enemy base is an effective strategy, but the AI doesn't adequately counter it.

The review highlights the game's visual presentation, noting the detailed and interesting urban environments, but also criticizing the overall color palette as being drab and gray.  The modeling of units is praised as strong, and the different races have enough variation to keep gameplay interesting.

The reviewer identifies a major flaw in the game's design: the lack of strategic depth in missions.  The missions are described as relying heavily on brute force and overwhelming numbers, rather than more inventive or nuanced approaches.  The reviewer contrasts this with the more varied and adventurous missions found in the game ""Battlezone,"" highlighting the absence of similar gameplay elements in ""Urban Assault.""

The review also discusses the different factions and enemies encountered in the game, including the Resistance, the Ghorkovs, the Taerkastens, the Mykonians, and the Sulgogars.  Each faction is described in terms of their technology, motivations, and strengths.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The review concludes that ""Urban Assault"" is an engaging game, but with significant flaws.  While the game's world and missions are interesting, the AI, base rush tactics, and lack of strategic depth are major drawbacks.  The review ultimately concludes that the game is worth playing, but only if the player is prepared to accept its limitations.  The reviewer recommends the game to players who have already enjoyed games like ""Battlezone"" and are looking for a similar experience, but with a slightly different focus.

The review itself is a lengthy critique, beginning with a summary of the game's core mechanics.  The reviewer notes that the game is a combat-driving game with resource management elements, but the game's setting in a bizarre alien universe is a key aspect.  The reviewer highlights the unusual premise of mankind discovering interstellar travel and encountering a species called the Cryspo, leading to a merging of species and a new race called Losties.

The review then delves into the game's gameplay, emphasizing the difficulty of navigating the game's 10 unique worlds.  The reviewer points out that the game's backstory, while intriguing, is presented in a confusing and convoluted manner, making it difficult for players to understand the game's objectives.  The reviewer also criticizes the control scheme, noting the lack of clear instructions and default button assignments.  The review also mentions the lack of multiplayer support documentation and the difficulty in finding opponents online.

The reviewer's overall impression is mixed.  While acknowledging the game's unique setting and some interesting gameplay elements, the reviewer ultimately concludes that the game's confusing backstory, frustrating driving mechanics, and poorly designed interface make it a difficult and ultimately unenjoyable experience for most players.

The review is rated 64%, indicating a somewhat average score.  The review highlights both positive aspects (superior terrain graphics, complex game world) and negative aspects (driving over terrain is more frustrating than fun, confusing manual and interface).  The final verdict summarizes the review's conclusion, stating that a decent game is hidden within the confusing presentation, but that only a few players will likely persevere through the complexities.

211,"This page is a PC Gamer review of the video game ""Motorhead.""

**Review Rating:** 88%

**Game Overview:** The review describes ""Motorhead"" as an arcade-style racing game set in a futuristic ""TransAtlantic Speed League.""  It features ten cars, each rated for speed, acceleration, and grip.  The game's tracks are diverse, ranging from the ""hazy skies of Red Rock"" to the ""urban thoroughfares of Neo City"" and the ""scenic shoreline of Olympos.""  The review highlights the game's emphasis on speed and exhilaration, rather than realism.

**Graphics and Gameplay:** The reviewer praises the game's graphics, particularly when a 3D card is used, noting the ""translucent lighting, fog, lens flares, shadows"" that create a sense of visual realism.  However, the review points out that a 3D card isn't necessary to play the game, but the graphics are more impressive with one.  The reviewer also notes the intense action and the satisfying feeling of speed.  A criticism is that the game doesn't show damage to cars during crashes.

**Multiplayer:** The review mentions the game's multiplayer options, including modem, serial, LAN, and Internet play.  It notes that the game has a feature allowing players to spawn multiple versions of the game, which is a positive aspect.  However, a negative point is that only a few tracks and cars are available at the start of the game, and players must achieve a certain level in the game to unlock more.

**Review Summary:** The review concludes that ""Motorhead"" is a satisfying arcade-style racing game, but it has some limitations, such as the limited tracks and cars available at the beginning and the lack of damage to cars during crashes.  Despite these drawbacks, the game's high-speed action and graphics are praised.

**Additional Information:** The page also includes a section with technical specifications for the game, including required hardware (Windows 95, Quad-speed CD-ROM drive, etc.) and recommended hardware (Eight-speed CD-ROM drive, etc.).

It discusses the 3D graphics engine, which is praised for its innovation in allowing full rotation and zooming, but also notes that the core gameplay loop (build base, build units, attack enemy) is fairly standard for the genre.  The reviewer contrasts this with other games like Bungie's *Myth*, highlighting that *WarGames* doesn't offer groundbreaking surprises but is still a solid experience.

**Campaign and Multiplayer:**

The review examines the single-player campaign, noting that it takes the premise of the film but diverges significantly, focusing on a conflict between WOPR (the military computer) and human forces.

The review praises the game's visuals, particularly the rendered 3D terrains, which are described as impressive and realistic.  The reviewer also mentions the effects of weather (snow, rain) on gameplay.  However, the reviewer notes that while the mechanized units look decent, the infantry units are less impressive.

222,"This page is a review of the video game ""Flesh Feast,"" published in PC Gamer magazine, October 1998.

The review is negative, giving the game a final verdict score of 32%.

**Review Details:**

The review begins by noting the game's category (Action), developer (SegaSoft), and publisher (SegaSoft).  It then lists the required system specifications (Windows 95, Quad-speed CD-ROM drive, Pentium 133, 16MB RAM, 3D accelerator with 4MB RAM) and recommended specifications (Eight-speed CD-ROM drive, Pentium 200, 32MB RAM, 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics-based accelerator).  It also mentions multiplayer capabilities (Modem: 28.8, Java enabled browser, IPX, Maximum players: 8, Free Internet Service).

The review criticizes several aspects of the game:

* **Gameplay:** The reviewer finds the gameplay tedious and repetitive.  The story, while described as creepy, doesn't translate into engaging gameplay.  The two modes of play (Strategic and Direct) are both poorly implemented, with the Strategic mode's clunky interface and the Direct mode's inability to effectively manage multiple characters.  The game's focus on finding keys and navigating mazes is highlighted as a major flaw.

* **Graphics:** The graphics are described as poor, even with hardware acceleration.  Character models are fuzzy and unrefined, and the visuals lack atmosphere.  The reviewer notes that the zombies are easily visible from a distance, negating any sense of suspense.  The colors blend together, creating a messy visual experience.

* **Story and Immersion:** The review points out that the game's story is presented primarily through cutscenes and text, with little player interaction.  The reviewer finds the game's attempt at horror to be unconvincing, noting that the game telegraphs its scares and lacks genuine tension.  The game's setting, a resort island, is described as a missed opportunity for atmosphere.

* **Controls and Interface:** The controls and interface are criticized as clunky and difficult to use.  The reviewer notes that switching between characters and weapons is problematic.

* **Overall Impression:** The reviewer concludes that despite the presence of zombies, the game is ultimately a boring action game focused on key-finding and navigating mazes.  The game's attempt at horror is deemed unconvincing, and the gameplay is described as tedious.

**Additional Notes:**

The review includes a screenshot of the game's environment, and a quote from the reviewer, William Harms, summarizing their experience.  The review also highlights the game's poor graphics and lack of atmosphere.  The reviewer's overall impression is that the game fails to deliver on its potential as a horror game.

**Overall Impression:** The reviewer initially expresses disappointment with the game's first impression, but ultimately concludes that ""Full Burn"" offers a good flight simulation experience for casual fans of the JetFighter series and those who want a more accessible flight sim.  The game's ease of use and comprehensive tutorials are highlighted as key strengths.

240,"This page is a review of a video game called NAM, published by GT Interactive.  The review, appearing in PC Gamer magazine (October 1998), is a mixed bag, giving the game a 53% rating.

**Game Overview:**

The game is categorized as a first-person shooter, set in the Vietnam War.  The review highlights the game's attempt to portray the realism of the conflict, but criticizes its execution.

**Technical Specifications:**

The review details the minimum and recommended system requirements for running the game.  The minimum requirements include a 486 DX4 100MHz processor, double-speed CD-ROM drive, 16MB RAM, and 60MB hard drive space.  The recommended specifications are higher, requiring a Pentium 133MHz processor, a video card capable of 640x580x256 resolution, a 28.8kbps modem, and a Sound Blaster 16 or compatible sound card.

**Gameplay and Review:**

The review begins by stating that NAM's claims to realism are bold, but the game's use of the Build engine results in a less-than-realistic portrayal of jungle combat, more akin to Duke Nukem's depiction of Da Nang.

The reviewer criticizes the game's portrayal of the Vietnam War, stating that the manual's claims of realistic character abilities and an ""experimental serum"" are unrealistic and don't reflect the harsh realities of the war.  The reviewer also notes that the game's depiction of enemy behavior and the environment is not entirely accurate.

However, the reviewer does acknowledge that the game does accurately portray one aspect of the war: the uncertainty of enemy fire locations.  The Fireteam mode, a multiplayer mode, is highlighted as a saving grace, emphasizing the importance of careful movement and cover in this mode.

**Graphics and Sound:**

The review is highly critical of the game's graphics, describing them as ""blockiest"" and ""sub-par.""  The reviewer notes that the game runs slower than other games using the Build engine, such as Redneck Rampage Rides Again.  The sound quality is not mentioned in detail.

**Multiplayer:**

The review praises the game's multiplayer mode, stating that it can be fun and potentially worth the price of the game.  The multiplayer modes include the standard Gruntmatch (deathmatch) and Capture the Flag.

**Overall Verdict:**

The reviewer concludes that while the multiplayer aspect might be enjoyable, the game's single-player mode, unrealistic claims of realism, and poor graphics make it a mixed experience.  The game's $19.99 price tag is questioned, as the reviewer suggests that the game's value is primarily in its multiplayer component.  The final verdict is a 53% rating, indicating a somewhat disappointing experience.

244,"This is a review of the video game ""Team Apache,"" published in PC Gamer magazine, October 1998.

The review is structured as follows:

**1. Overview and Comparison:**

The review begins by placing ""Team Apache"" within the context of other flight simulators, noting that it sits between the more rigorous ""Longbow II"" and the action-oriented ""Comanche.""  It highlights the game's focus on tactics and command elements within an attack helicopter squadron.

**2. System Requirements and Recommendations:**

A table lists the minimum and recommended system requirements for running the game, including specific processor, RAM, graphics card, video card, hard drive space, and sound card specifications.

**3. Gameplay and Simulation:**

The review delves into the game's simulation aspects. It notes that the game has an agenda, sometimes focusing on the physical rigors of flight, sometimes on avionics and instrumentation, and sometimes on a balance of both.  The review contrasts this with other helicopter simulators, like ""Apache,"" which doesn't prioritize the same level of avionics fidelity but instead emphasizes the pilot's workload and decision-making.  The reviewer praises the game's sense of ""workload"" and the realistic depiction of the pilot's tasks.  However, the review also points out some shortcomings, such as the game's ""soft"" modeling of avionics and the lack of control over certain features like radar and jammers.

**4. Cockpit Design and Obstacles:**

The review dedicates a significant section to the game's cockpit design, labeling it as a ""weak point.""  It introduces the concept of ""three degrees of obfuscation"" to describe the different ways the cockpit view can be problematic.  The review details three different cockpit views:

* **Clear:**  Provides the least obscured view of the graphics, but lacks sensor overlays.
* **Rendered:** Offers a good wide view and clear instruments, but lacks a full range of side views.
* **Virtual:**  Features quick and smooth scrolling, but the instruments are too fuzzy and the shimmering light effect is difficult to read.

The review criticizes the virtual cockpit for its obscured view, fuzzy instruments, and the difficulty in reading the instruments due to the light effects.

**5. Overall Assessment:**

The review concludes by summarizing the game's strengths and weaknesses. While acknowledging the game's strengths in certain areas, such as the sense of workload and the focus on tactics, the review ultimately criticizes the cockpit design as a significant drawback.  The reviewer notes that the game's ""soft"" modeling of avionics and the lack of control over certain features are also shortcomings.

**6. Rating:**

There is no explicit numerical rating given in the review.  However, the overall tone and specific criticisms suggest a mixed or potentially negative assessment of the game's quality.

245,"This page is a review of the computer game ""Team Apache,"" published in PC Gamer magazine in October 1998.

The review gives the game an 80% rating.

The review is broken down into several sections:

**Graphics and Sound:** The reviewer praises the visuals, particularly the hardware and software rendering modes, which provide ""superb frame rates"" on mid-range systems.  Object modeling and textures are generally strong, but the terrain is described as repetitive in some areas.  The reviewer notes that the cockpits are somewhat problematic.

**Gameplay:** The reviewer highlights the quasi-roleplaying command element as a key strength.  However, the missions are criticized for being ""hard-wired"" and the campaign scripted, lacking the dynamic generation of missions found in other games.  The game's focus on crew management and leadership is also noted, but the lack of numerical ratings for crew performance is a drawback.  Resource management, including supplies and maintenance, is also a significant part of the gameplay.  The reviewer also points out the importance of rest for helicopter crews in the game.

**Teamwork and AI:** The reviewer emphasizes the importance of teamwork in the game, but criticizes the AI of the opposing pilots as often being ""utter idiots"" in the early stages.  The AI's behavior is inconsistent, sometimes obeying commands and sometimes not.  The reviewer also notes that the mission structure is interesting, with a mix of rescue, escort, search, and destroy missions.

**Similarities and Differences:** The reviewer compares ""Team Apache"" to other helicopter combat sims, like U.S. Navy Fighters and Longbow II.  The game is described as falling in the middle ground in terms of realism, capturing the dynamics of commanding a team of attack helicopters but with some unrealistic elements.

**Overall Impression:** The reviewer concludes that ""Team Apache"" is a unique and interesting helicopter combat simulator.  While the targeting and cockpit controls might take some getting used to, the game emphasizes human dynamics over twitching and hand-eye skill.  The reviewer finds the game enjoyable and engaging, despite some minor flaws.

**Review Section:**

The review section discusses Creative Labs' new Sound Blaster Live! sound card, highlighting its key features and comparing it to competitors.  It emphasizes the card's use of the E-MU10K1 audio processor chip, claiming it's the most powerful integrated hardware audio and effects engine available.  The article also touches on Creative's ""Environmental Audio"" technology, which aims to improve positional audio by including reverb effects.

The review criticizes other competing technologies, particularly Aureal's A3D, arguing that it doesn't effectively create true sound environments.  The review uses an example of a quiet sound near a listener being perceived as far away as a loud sound further away to illustrate this point.  It suggests that volume alone isn't enough to create a realistic sense of distance and that the Sound Blaster Live! is better at achieving this.

The review also mentions the card's ability to support more than two speakers, a feature not always present in competing cards.  It highlights the benefits of using more speakers for positional audio, drawing a comparison to Dolby Surround.

**Other Sections:**

There's a separate section with the headline ""WRONG!""  This section is a humorous, almost antagonistic, call to action, encouraging the reader to go back to the basics of a game (likely baseball) and learn the fundamentals.  It's not directly related to the sound card review but is likely a separate editorial piece or advertisement.

**Visuals:**

The page includes a graphic of a baseball player batting, a graphic of the Sound Blaster Live! logo, and a graphic of the E-MU10K1 chip.  These visuals help to illustrate the article's points and make the information more engaging.

273,"This page is a review of the Pionex 640029 400MHz computer system, published in PC Gamer in October 1998.

The review is presented in a standard review format, with a headline, company information, phone number, price, and a brief introductory paragraph.

The review begins with a description of the system's specifications, including the processor (Pentium II 400MHz), RAM (64MB SDRAM), hard drive (12GB EIDE), DVD-ROM drive, and video card (MPACT2 Media Processor).  The review notes the system's components, such as the sound card (Ensoniq Audio PCI), monitor (Pionex 17""), and other peripherals.

The review then delves into the performance of the system, focusing on its 3D graphics capabilities.  The reviewer notes that the MPACT2 video card performed poorly in 3D benchmarks, consistently falling below expected results, especially at higher resolutions.  The review also points out that the system's sound card is a basic ISA card, not a full PCI card, which is a drawback for gaming.

The review concludes with a ""Highs"" and ""Lows"" section, highlighting the system's strengths (large hard drive, generous case) and weaknesses (poor 3D performance, lack of a dedicated graphics card).  The overall verdict is that the system is not worth the price, and that a better system can be found for the same price.  The review recommends further comparison shopping.

The review includes a table of benchmark results for various 3D and other tests, showing the system's performance in different applications.  The review also includes a ""System Specs"" section, providing a detailed list of the system's components.

The review is prominently featured, with a large headline and a graphic of the card.  The page details the card's specifications, performance, and overall value proposition.

**Product Overview:**

The review highlights the Matrox Mystique G200 as a new 2D/3D graphics card from Matrox, a company known for high-performance 2D accelerators.  It's positioned as a serious contender in the market, offering both 2D and 3D capabilities.  Key features mentioned include a slightly lower RAMDAC speed (230MHz compared to 250MHz in the Millennium G200), a software bundle (games instead of applications), and a TV output.

**2D Performance:**

The review extensively tests the card's 2D performance, concluding that it performs as advertised, matching or exceeding the performance of other top 2D accelerators.  However, the review notes that the difference in frame rates between a good and a great 2D accelerator is often minimal, especially in games.  The review uses benchmark tests like Quake II to evaluate performance.

**3D Performance:**

The 3D performance is also assessed, and the card is found to be faster than some competitors (like Intel's i740) in some tests, particularly at 1024x768 resolution.  However, the review notes that the performance advantage is not consistent across all resolutions.  The review also highlights the card's 24-bit color capabilities and how it handles various game scenarios.

**Bootmarks:**

A section titled ""Bootmarks"" presents benchmark results for the Mystique G200 in various tests, including Quake, Forsaken, Duke Nukem 3D, and MDK Perftest.  These results show the card's performance in different game scenarios and with different rendering modes.

**Overall Assessment:**

The review concludes that the Mystique G200 is a strong performer in both 2D and 3D, surpassing many other 2D/3D combinations on the market.  The review praises the card's image quality and the included game bundle.  However, a significant drawback is the lack of an OpenGL driver at the time of the review, which is a concern for some users.  The review also mentions that an 8MB upgrade is available for an additional cost.

**Editor's Choice:**

The card is highlighted as an Editors' Choice, indicating the publication's positive assessment of the product.

**Final Verdict:**

The final verdict section summarizes the review's key findings, highlighting the card's strengths (speed, image quality, and game bundle) and weaknesses (lack of OpenGL driver).  It concludes that the Mystique G200 is a strong choice for users looking for a powerful 2D/3D graphics card, especially if they are on a budget.

**ADS USB Hub Review:**

* **Rating:**  The review doesn't explicitly give a star rating, but the overall tone is positive.
* **Company:** ADS Technologies
* **Price:** $69 (MSRP)
* **Description:** This is a four-port USB hub.  The review highlights its compatibility with Windows 98's built-in USB support.  It's noted as a simple, functional device that gets the job done, though not the most aesthetically pleasing.  The review praises the ease of installation and the fact that the hub works with a variety of devices, including speakers.  The review also mentions the limited availability of USB devices at the time, which might make the hub seem less necessary.  The review also notes that the hub supports both high-speed (12Mbps) and low-speed (1.5Mbps) peripherals.
* **Pros:** Easy setup, works with various devices, supports both high and low speed peripherals.
* **Cons:**  Not the most visually appealing.
* **Final Verdict:** The review concludes that the hub is a good choice for those needing additional USB ports, especially given the limited availability of USB devices at the time.


**Diamond Monster Sound MX200 PC Review:**

* **Rating:** The review doesn't explicitly give a star rating, but the overall tone is positive, with a ""PC Gamer Editors' Choice"" designation.
* **Company:** Diamond Multimedia
* **Price:** $149 (MSRP)
* **Description:** This is a sound card designed for use with PCs.  The review highlights its support for 3D audio (A3D), DirectSound, and DirectSound3D.  It's designed to handle four-speaker surround sound setups.  The review notes that the card has a full version of ""Incoming"" and ""Jedi Knight demo, Pathways to the Force"" bundled with it.  A key point of the review is the card's legacy support for older DOS-based games, which is lacking compared to other cards.
* **Pros:** Excellent sound quality, supports four-speaker surround sound, A3D and DirectSound support.
* **Cons:** Limited DOS support, slightly more expensive than comparable cards.
* **Final Verdict:** The review concludes that the card is an excellent sound card with high-end features, but its lack of DOS support might be a drawback for some users.  The review also suggests that if the user doesn't need four-speaker support, a less expensive alternative might be a better choice.

**Final Verdict:** The review section provides a concise summary of the controller's strengths and weaknesses, using the terms ""HIGHS"" and ""LOWS"" to categorize the aspects.  It concludes with a ""BOTTOM LINE"" that advises potential buyers to test the controller if the tilt sensor is a primary concern.

300,"This page is an article from PC Gamer magazine, October 1998, reviewing the ""The Revenge of the Return of the Bundleware"" expansion pack for the X-Wing and TIE Fighter games.  The article is a lengthy review, covering multiple aspects of the product.

**Review of ""The Revenge of the Return of the Bundleware""**

The review, written by T. Liam McDonald, gives a mixed assessment of the expansion pack.  While acknowledging the classics status of the X-Wing and TIE Fighter games, the reviewer criticizes the expansion pack for its limited scope and lack of significant new content.

* **Limited Scope:** The expansion pack, ""Flight School,"" is a limited version of the original game, offering only fourteen missions and nine spacecraft.  It's designed for multiplayer play, but only against other players using the same limited version, and only via network or modem.  Internet play is not supported.  The reviewer notes that this is essentially a demo, not a substantial expansion.

* **Incompatibility:** The expansion pack is incompatible with the full version of X-Wing and TIE Fighter, and there's no disc-spawning option.

* **Lack of New Content:** The reviewer points out that there are no new missions or campaigns in the expansion.  The primary change is Direct3D support, which enhances graphics, but the reviewer feels the improvements are not substantial enough to justify the purchase.

* **Positive Aspects:** The reviewer does acknowledge the classic status of the games and the fact that the collection is completely Win 95-native, with about 250 missions.  The reviewer also notes the solid visual enhancements and the reasonable price point.

* **Strategy Guide:** The review highlights the inclusion of a 103-page strategy guide, but criticizes it for being padded with unintentionally humorous short stories from hunters, rather than providing actual strategies.

* **""More Huntin' and Peckin'"" Section:** This section reviews a separate expansion pack for Deer Hunter, which is also discussed in the article.  The reviewer notes the insanity of the expansion pack's continued release, and the lack of substance in the expansion.

**Overall Rating (Implied):**

While the review doesn't explicitly assign a numerical rating, the overall tone is critical of the expansion pack's value.  The reviewer highlights the lack of substantial new content and the limited scope of the expansion, while acknowledging the classic status of the original games.
