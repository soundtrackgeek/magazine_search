The review, which takes up a significant portion of the page, is by Shaun Griffiths.  The reviewer gives a mixed assessment of the game.  While acknowledging the game's good graphics and professional presentation, the reviewer criticizes the game's lack of originality and engaging gameplay.  The reviewer states that the game, while not bad, doesn't offer enough to warrant playing beyond the initial playthrough.  The reviewer feels the game is somewhat derivative of other Bitmap Brothers games, particularly ""Gods,"" and that the game's level design and sprite design are uninspired.

**Review Section:**

The review, titled ""Bitmaps to come back with a real winner, but does Pockets have that magic?"", is a critical analysis of the game. The reviewer expresses mixed feelings.  While acknowledging some interesting ideas behind the game's level design (e.g., levels based on different cultures or historical periods), they find the gameplay itself lacking.  The reviewer criticizes the following aspects:

* **Gameplay Mechanics:** The character movement and control are described as slow and cumbersome, particularly in changing direction during jumps.  The repetitive nature of the combat, requiring multiple hits to defeat enemies, is highlighted as a significant flaw.  The reviewer notes that the game's weapon system, while esoteric, doesn't feel intuitive or rewarding to master.
* **Pace and Feel:** The overall pace of the game is deemed too slow and the character feels too heavy.  The reviewer feels the game's design is inconsistent with the expected feel of an arcade-style game.
* **Skill Requirement:** The reviewer argues that the game's skill requirement is misplaced.  The player should be able to master the weapon's arc and hit enemies effectively, rather than needing to repeatedly attack them.

**Game Overview/Gameplay Details:**

The page also includes a section describing the game's mechanics and features.  It details different weapons and their effects:

* **Whirlwinds:** A powerful weapon found early in the game that can trap enemies and spin the player around the room, dealing damage to enemies.
* **Clouds:** A weapon that creates platforms in the form of rainbow islands, allowing the player to traverse the level.
* **Ice Cubes:** A weapon that freezes water, allowing the player to cross otherwise impassable areas.
* **Snowballs:** A weapon that grows in size as it picks up snow, allowing for powerful attacks.

The review also includes screenshots and descriptions of the game's environments and enemies.  The descriptions of the enemies (e.g., ""green blob things,"" ""frogs"") and the environments (e.g., ""ancient cultures"") provide a sense of the game's visual style and thematic elements.

**Overall:**

The review gives a critical assessment of the game, highlighting its flaws in gameplay mechanics and pace.  The reviewer acknowledges some interesting ideas but ultimately finds the game repetitive and lacking in the expected skill-based challenge.  The detailed descriptions of the game's weapons and environments provide a good understanding of the game's mechanics. The review rating is not explicitly stated on the page.

* **Publisher:** Magic Bytes
* **Price:** £25.99

* **Release:** Out now

The review describes the game as a chess-like game played with dinosaurs, set in the prehistoric era.

The reviewer, Rich Pelley, notes that the beat-'em-up elements are not very good, and the game is too simplistic.  The reviewer also mentions the graphics are nice.

81,"This page is a review section from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, from October 1991.  The article focuses on a review of a lightgun and two accompanying games, ""Ten Up, Wiseguy,"" developed by Trojan Peripherals.

**Review of ""Ten Up, Wiseguy""**

The review begins with a headline that is somewhat sarcastic, ""desperate quest for a funny, pithy or just plain original lightgun headline, and oh dear...""  The review itself is a detailed look at the lightgun and its accompanying games.

* **Lightgun:** The review describes the lightgun as having a classic space-age style and outward appearance.  It's compared to a Spectrum lightgun, noting similarities in design.  The reviewer points out the gun's lightweight nature and a potential issue with the trigger sticking after extended use.  The range of the gun is also mentioned, being about four feet, which is suitable for desk-based use but not for across-room play.  The reviewer notes that the gun flashes white briefly after each shot, a feature present in the Spectrum version.

* **Games:** The review discusses two games bundled with the lightgun:
    * **Skeet Shoot:**  This game is described as a typical lightgun game, with good graphics and a satisfying aiming and shooting experience.  The reviewer highlights the action and entertainment value.
    * **Orbital Destroyer:** This game is considered less engaging, described as an ""arbitrary exercise"" where shooting at the screen results in some enemies dying, but the aiming isn't precise.

* **Additional Games:** The review mentions other games that can be purchased separately, including ""The Enforcer,"" a gangster-style shoot-out game set in Chicago.  This game is praised for its engaging gameplay and variety of targets (psycho grannies, bent cops, mobsters).

* **Overall Impression:** The review concludes with a mixed assessment.  While the lightgun itself is functional and the Skeet Shoot game is enjoyable, the Orbital Destroyer game is less compelling.  The reviewer notes the potential for more interesting software to emerge for the lightgun in the future.  The review also touches on the fact that the lightgun's price is reasonable considering the price of a mouse or joystick.

**Rating:**  There isn't an explicit numerical rating, but the review provides a detailed analysis of the pros and cons of the lightgun and its bundled games.  The overall tone suggests a somewhat lukewarm, but not entirely negative, assessment.
