104,"This page is a collection of game reviews from Amiga Power magazine, October 1993.  It features reviews for three different games: 18th Hole, Starians, and Jonus Fulstraand, along with Star Base 13. Each review includes a rating, a description of the game, and a verdict.

**18th Hole:**

* **Rating:** **** (Four stars)
* **Description:** The review describes 18th Hole as a golf simulation that feels more like a maze than a realistic golf course.  The fairways are described as twisting and turning in an unrealistic manner, and the gameplay involves tricky ball control using arrow keys to direct the ball and a mouse-based power selection.  The game's control system is considered bizarre and difficult to master.  The one-player mode is a tournament with five other computer-controlled players.
* **Verdict:** While a flawed golf simulation, the game has a certain charm.

**Starians:**

* **Rating:** ââ (Two stars)
* **Description:** The review describes Starians as a fairly dull platformer with predictable gameplay.  The graphics are colorful and detailed, but not interesting.  The controls are described as unresponsive, and the levels are repetitive.  The game has a few levels, but the reviewer got bored after the first six.
* **Verdict:** The game is a yawn-inducing experience.

**Jonus Fulstraand:**

* **Rating:** âââ (Three stars)
* **Description:** The review describes Jonus Fulstraand as a slow, old-fashioned platform game with a dreadful look.  The controls are frustratingly irritating.  However, the reviewer found the game's difficulty and tricky obstacles enjoyable.  The game is described as a platform game focused on timed leaps, with obstacles appearing quickly.  The graphics are described as looking like Egyptian hieroglyphics, but the levels are massive and allow for impressive progress.
* **Verdict:** The game is tacky but has a certain charm.

**Star Base 13:**

* **Rating:** âââ (Three stars)
* **Description:** The review describes Star Base 13 as an aesthetically pleasing and playable, but not very deep, adventure game.  The graphics are impressive, and the control system is logical and comprehensive.  The plot is described as suitably dumb sci-fi nonsense.  However, the character interactions are not very exciting, and the game has an irritating habit of killing the player without warning.
* **Verdict:** The game is aesthetically pleasing and playable, but not very deep.


Each review also includes a brief mention of the game's shareware price.  The page also includes contact information for the developer.

106,"The image is a promotional poster or advertisement, likely for a product or software related to the Amiga computer.

The central image is a light beige teddy bear with a light reddish-orange ribbon wrapped around it, and a snake wrapped around the teddy bear's body. The snake is a light brownish-tan color with darker markings. The background is entirely black.
