**Review Rating:** The review gives the game a 74% rating on the A500 and an 80% rating on the A1200.

**Game Overview:** The review begins by describing the game's atmosphere and gameplay.  It highlights the black-and-white opening credits and piano music, followed by the in-game experience of navigating an airstrip, encountering friendly planes, and engaging in dogfights.  The reviewer notes that the game's missions begin in the air, and the player is not initially aware of what's happening on the ground.

**Gameplay Analysis:** The review contrasts ""Dawn Patrol"" with another game, ""Volkswagon,"" noting that ""Dawn Patrol"" is a good product but somewhat dull, with missions carefully staged and predictable.  The reviewer points out that the player doesn't get to experience true patrol-style gameplay, as missions are more structured.  The review also mentions the game's two-player serial link option and the realistic (or exaggerated) depiction of planes and targets.

**Aircraft and History:** The review discusses the evolution of aircraft during World War I, noting the rapid improvements from early, rudimentary designs to more sophisticated models.  It highlights the game's inclusion of 13 different aircraft types, each with information about their specifications.  The review also includes a section on the history of ""turning"" to different pages to access information about specific periods of the war and missions.

**Pilot Biographies:** The review discusses the game's pilot biographies, noting that the game features eight fictional pilots, but the player can't customize them.  The reviewer highlights this as a limitation, contrasting it with the more engaging experience of choosing from a wider range of pilots and missions in other games.

**Technical Aspects:** The review praises the game's incredibly realistic behavior of the computer-controlled aircraft, detailed graphics, and a novel ""EduInfoTainment"" approach that provides interesting information.  However, the review also points out the lack of ground action, limited scenery, poor sound effects, and a lack of World War I atmosphere.

**Bottom Line:** The review concludes with two ""Bottom Line"" sections, one for each platform (A500 and A1200).  Both sections summarize the game's strengths and weaknesses.  The A500 version is described as running fine but with a slightly jerky experience, while the A1200 version is praised for its incredibly realistic aircraft behavior and detailed graphics.  Ultimately, the review suggests that while the game is a comprehensive World War I flight simulator, it falls short of other games in terms of atmosphere and excitement.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing the game's minimalist graphics, noting that the screen displays a small portion of the overall game area.

59,"This page is from a magazine article, likely a game guide or strategy guide, for a game called ""Cannon Fodder 2"".  The page details a specific mission, Mission 10, with instructions and strategy advice.

**Mission 10:**

The page describes a mission with two phases.  The text provides detailed instructions for each phase, including specific actions to take.

**Phase 1:**

The text emphasizes the difficulty of managing the knights and the pigs within the compound.  It advises players to stay inside the compound to avoid the knights' accuracy, but warns that the compound is full of exploding pigs.  The strategy involves quickly shooting the pigs, running past the first few huts, and then using grenades to destroy two huts near the compound entrance.  This action slows the rush of troops into the pig pen, giving the player more time to shoot the pigs and collect grenades.  The final step is to use the grenades to destroy the remaining huts outside the compound.

**Phase 2:**

The text acknowledges that this phase is more random and unpredictable.  It states that even with knowledge of the strategy, players may need to repeatedly try different approaches until they succeed.  The key problem is that destroying civilian huts results in failure.  The strategy involves crossing the river, destroying the tank turret, and sending troops to destroy the tank.  The text admits that this phase isn't as satisfying as other parts of the game.

**Visuals:**

The page includes several pixelated maps or diagrams of the game's battlefield.  These maps show the layout of the compound, the positions of enemies, and the locations of important objects like huts, tanks, and the river.
