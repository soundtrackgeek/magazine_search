**TRANSPLANT:**

* **Rating:** 4 stars
* **Review Summary:**  The reviewer describes Transplant as an Asteroids-style game with a unique twist: the background moves instead of the ship.  While initially disorienting, the motion effect is praised as excellent.  The graphics, music, and sound effects are also highlighted as strong points.  The reviewer notes a lack of variation in the alien attackers after a while, but overall finds the game a decent blast-em-up with a fun twist.

**BALDY:**

* **Rating:** 3 stars
* **Review Summary:** The reviewer describes Baldy as a game based on a grandad character, who moves around collecting computer disks on platforms.  The graphics are praised as great, and the game is considered a fairly amusing puzzler.  However, the reviewer notes that the game's replay value is limited, with its life expectancy being less than its hero's.

**KLAKTRIS:**

* **Rating:** 3 stars
* **Review Summary:**  The reviewer describes Klaktris as a cross between Tetris and Columns, with colorful graphics and animation.  However, the game is deemed tedious.  The reviewer notes that while the animation is excellent on the A500, it flickers badly on the A6/1200.  The reviewer suggests waiting for a later version.

**NIRVANA (The Mobius Strip):**

* **Rating:** 3 stars
* **Review Summary:** The reviewer expresses disappointment with Nirvana, stating that it looks like a game with potential but ultimately falls short.  The game is described as blobby, with a poor collision detection system, relentless one-speed scrolling, and predictable enemy patterns.  While the reviewer acknowledges some platform fun and visual touches, the overall impression is negative.

**TAKE THAT SEUCKERS:**

* **Rating:**  Not explicitly rated, but the review is positive.
* **Review Summary:** The review focuses on the Dominator game within the collection.  It's described as a competent but predictable sideways scrolling shoot-'em-up.  The reviewer notes the game's great visuals and a primitive attempt at parallax scrolling.  The game is set in space with alien attack ships.  The reviewer also notes the annoying shooting system where you blast in the direction you last moved your joystick.

94,"This page is a section from a magazine, likely a gaming magazine, featuring a ""Games Round-Up"" article.  The article focuses on a series of games that are suspected of being clones or having significant similarities to other games.  The tone is humorous and investigative, as if a kangaroo court is being held to determine the originality of the games.

The article features three game comparisons:

**1. Lemmings (Psygnosis) vs. Troddlers (Storm):**  The article presents arguments for and against the games being clones.  The prosecution highlights similarities in gameplay, particularly the ""indirect control"" aspect and the use of numerous small sprites.  The defense argues that the game styles are common and that there are nine different game styles in the world. The court ultimately finds Troddlers ""Not Guilty.""

**2. Spot The Ball Game (Virgin) vs. The Ball Game (Electronic Zoo):**  The prosecution argues that Spot The Ball Game is a direct copy of an unreleased game from Virgin.  The defense claims that the game is a unique take on the abstract board game concept. The court finds Spot The Ball Game ""Guilty.""

**3. Gods (Renegade) vs. Deliverance (21st Century):**  The prosecution argues that Deliverance is a clone of Gods, differing only in color palette and some complexity. The defense argues that the platform game genre is not unique and that the game is a standard platformer. The court finds Deliverance ""Not Proven.""

The article is written in a conversational style, using phrases like ""funny déjà vu feeling"" and ""guilty parties.""  It includes screenshots or visual representations of the games being discussed.  The article also features a judge, Judge Stuart Campbell, who presides over the ""kangaroo court.""  The overall tone is lighthearted, but the article also touches on the issue of game originality and the potential for copying in the gaming industry.  The article concludes with the statement that no platformer can claim to be entirely original.
"
95,"This page is a section from a gaming magazine, likely a review or round-up of video games.  It features reviews and commentary on several arcade games, focusing on their similarities and differences, and whether they are original or derivative.

The review discusses the games' platforming and zapping elements, icy world, underwater sections, and hidden secrets.  It also touches on the character movement and overall gameplay.  The review concludes with a verdict from a ""court,"" which finds the games to be an improvement over previous titles and worthy of a conditional discharge.

* **""ATOMIX (Thalion) THE POWER (Demonware)"" Section:** This section reviews ""Atomix"" and ""The Power"".  The review criticizes ""The Power"" for being too similar to ""Atomix"" in its gameplay, specifically mentioning the sliding blocks and abstract spatial manipulation.  The review notes that ""The Power"" introduces new elements, but ultimately finds it a bit dubious, especially given the similarities to the older game.  The ""court"" verdict is a bit more nuanced, acknowledging some improvements but still finding the game somewhat derivative.

* **""PANG (Ocean) OOPS UP (Demonware)"" Section:** This section reviews ""Pang"" and ""Oops Up"".  The review strongly criticizes ""Oops Up"" for blatant copying of the original ""Pang"" game design, including the music and gameplay.  The review calls it a ""rip-off"" and notes the lack of original backgrounds.  The ""court"" verdict is a harsh condemnation of the game's lack of originality.

* **""LOTUS TURBO CHALLENGE 2 (Gremlin) JAGUAR XJ220 (Core)"" Section:** This section reviews ""Lotus Turbo Challenge 2"" and ""Jaguar XJ220"".
