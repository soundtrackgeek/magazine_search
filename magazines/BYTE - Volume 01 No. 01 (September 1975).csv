"
53,"This page is an article, likely from a computer programming magazine (like BYTE), explaining how assemblers work.  It focuses on a specific challenge in assembly language programming: the ""forward reference problem.""

The article begins by explaining the general concept of assembly language and machine instructions.  It details how instructions are composed of an opcode (operation code) and operands.  Operands can represent numerical values, ASCII characters, or memory addresses.  The example given uses the Motorola 6800 processor.

The article then introduces the concept of an assembler, which translates human-readable assembly code into machine code.  It highlights the assembler's role in taking assembly instructions and converting them into the binary patterns that the computer can understand.

A key section of the article is the explanation of the ""forward reference problem.""  Using a diagram (Figure 1), it illustrates how an assembler encounters a situation where it needs to know the address of a label (like ""THERE"" in the example) before it can fully assemble the code.  The assembler doesn't know the address of ""THERE"" until it has processed all the code up to that point.  The article explains that there's no straightforward solution to this problem, and the assembler must perform calculations to determine the correct addresses.

The article provides concrete examples of assembly instructions, showing how they are translated into binary code.  It also demonstrates how pseudo-ops (like ""RMB"") are used to reserve memory locations without directly specifying the instruction's location.

The article concludes with a practical example of a subroutine with a jump instruction, further illustrating the forward reference problem and how the assembler must handle it.  It emphasizes the importance of understanding this problem for writing correct and efficient assembly code.

There are diagrams and examples throughout the article to illustrate the concepts being discussed.  The overall tone is instructional and informative, aimed at readers who are learning about assembly language programming.
"
54,"This page contains a technical explanation of two-pass assemblers, focusing on the scanning techniques used in the process.

**Section 1: Two-Pass Assembler Overview**

The text begins by describing a two-pass assembler, a method for translating assembly language into machine code.  It explains that a two-pass assembler reads the program twice.  The first pass creates a symbol table, mapping symbolic names (e.g., variable names) to their memory addresses. The second pass substitutes the symbolic names with their corresponding addresses, converting the entire assembly language program into machine code.  The explanation highlights the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of this approach compared to a single-pass method, where the entire program would need to be held in memory at once.

**Section 2: Scanning Techniques**

The core of the page details the scanning techniques used in the first pass of the assembler.  It emphasizes the importance of efficiently scanning the assembly language code to identify instruction mnemonics, constants, and programmer-defined names.  The text contrasts a ""kluge"" approach (a less structured, ad-hoc method) with a more structured approach using regular expressions, right-linear grammars, and finite automata.  The author advocates for a middle ground, suggesting techniques to make a hand-implemented scanner simpler and faster.

**Section 3: Assembly Language Format**

The page describes different formats for assembly language statements.  It discusses two approaches: the ""IBM approach"" and the ""DEC approach.""  The IBM approach requires statement labels to start in column 1, mnemonics to be preceded by a blank, and comments to be separated from operands by a blank. The DEC approach uses colons to separate labels from the rest of the statement, and comments are preceded by semicolons.  A typical example of an assembly language statement is provided, illustrating the components (statement label, mnemonic, operand field, and comments).

**Section 4: Illustration and Example**

A diagram (Fig. 2) visually represents the first pass of the assembler, showing how it picks up labels.  Another diagram (Fig. 3) is likely referenced but not present in the provided image.  A sample assembly language instruction (LDAA, BETA, BEGIN FUNCTION EVALUATION) is given as an example, demonstrating the components of a statement in the DEC approach.

**Overall:**

The page is a technical document explaining the inner workings of a two-pass assembler, focusing on the scanning techniques used in the first pass.  It provides a detailed explanation of the process, different approaches, and examples to illustrate the concepts.  The page is aimed at a technical audience familiar with assembly language and computer programming.
"
55,"This page contains technical documentation, likely from a computer programming manual or textbook.  It describes a method for processing assembly language statements, focusing on how to identify and categorize different parts of the code (like labels, instructions, and operands).

**Figure 3:**  The figure shows a diagram illustrating a process called ""PASS 2,"" which generates code referencing labels.  It visually depicts assembly language instructions (e.g., ""LDAA THERE,"" ""JMP BACK"") and their corresponding memory locations.  The diagram also shows how these instructions are arranged and processed.

**Text accompanying Figure 3:** The text explains the advantages and disadvantages of using this method.  It highlights that while the method is convenient and less error-prone for the user, it can be slightly harder to analyze.  The text also provides examples of how to scan strings of characters to identify different parts of an assembly language statement.  It emphasizes the importance of a ""next token"" routine to separate the process of scanning individual characters from the process of determining how to handle each element of a statement.

**Figure 4:** This figure is a diagram illustrating how descriptors identify text tokens in a line of characters.  It shows a hierarchical structure with ""length"" and ""location"" as key elements.  It visually represents how different parts of an assembly language statement are identified and stored.  The diagram shows how the method uses a table to translate character codes for easier processing.

**Text accompanying Figure 4:** The text explains the concept of descriptors and how they are used to identify different parts of an assembly language statement.  It discusses the advantages of using fixed-size descriptors and how they can be used to store information about the statement's components.  It also explains how this method can be used to handle error messages and other complex situations.  The text also discusses the use of ASCII character codes and how a translation table can be used to improve efficiency.

**Figure 5 (implied):**  The text mentions Figure 5, but the figure itself is not present on the page.  The text suggests that Figure 5 would show the flow of information from a character code translation routine to a next token routine, and finally to a routine that determines the type of statement.

**Overall:** The page describes a method for parsing assembly language code, focusing on the use of descriptors and a ""next token"" routine to improve efficiency and organization.  It emphasizes the use of modularity and hierarchical structure to handle complex problems.  The text also discusses the use of character codes and translation tables to improve the handling of different characters and strings.  The figures illustrate the concepts described in the text.
"
56,"This page contains a technical description of a character translation and next token routine, likely part of a computer program or assembler.  It's a detailed explanation of the steps involved in processing character strings, specifically focusing on how the system handles alphabetic, numeric, and special characters (like colons).

The page is structured around a flowchart-like diagram showing different routines:

* **Statement Type Determination Routine:** This is a high-level routine that determines the type of statement being processed.

* **Character Code Translation Routine:** This routine handles the conversion of character codes into a usable format.

* **""Next Token"" Routine:** This routine extracts and processes individual ""tokens"" (words, numbers, symbols) from the input string.

* **Symbol Table Lookup Routine:** This routine looks up the meaning of symbols (variables, labels, etc.) in a symbol table.

The text explains how these routines work together to identify and process characters, including the handling of colons to distinguish labels.  It also describes the use of a jump table (BRTAB) to quickly route to the appropriate handling routine for different character types.

The page also details the structure of the symbol table itself.  It explains how the assembler uses this table to translate symbolic names into their corresponding memory addresses.  The table contains both programmer-defined names (in character strings) and the binary addresses.  It also mentions that the table can include instruction mnemonics and pseudo-ops.

The overall tone is technical and instructional, providing a step-by-step breakdown of the process.  The page is likely part of a larger document, like a programming manual or technical specification, aimed at programmers or engineers working with the system.  The use of assembly language mnemonics (like MVI, LDAX, MOV, etc.) indicates that the target system uses assembly language.
"
57,"This page contains a technical description, likely from a computer science textbook or manual, about how an assembler handles symbol tables.  It's explaining different methods for organizing and searching symbol tables, which are crucial components of assemblers.

**Figure 6: An Array Symbol Table**

The figure shows a diagram of a symbol table organized as an array.  The text explains that this is a simple method where entries are added sequentially.  The table is used to find the addresses of programmer-defined names during a second pass of the assembly process.  Each descriptor is compared to an operand in a comparison routine.  If the strings are unequal in length, the comparison fails immediately.  The text highlights the simplicity of this approach but also notes that it becomes less efficient as the number of names increases.

**Figure 7: An Alphabetically Indexed Symbol Table**

This figure illustrates a more sophisticated method.  The symbol table is divided into 26 sections, one for each letter of the alphabet.  This allows the assembler to quickly locate names starting with a particular letter.  The text explains that the assembler looks at the first character of a name to determine which section to search.  This approach is faster than searching the entire array, especially with a large number of names.  The text also raises questions about the size of each section and how to handle cases where a section fills up.

**Overall Description**

The page discusses the organization of symbol tables in an assembler.  It contrasts a simple array-based approach (Fig. 6) with a more sophisticated alphabetically indexed approach (Fig. 7).  The text emphasizes the trade-offs between simplicity and efficiency in different symbol table designs.  It highlights how the choice of organization affects the assembler's performance, particularly as the number of names in the program increases.  The text also touches on the concept of ""passes"" in assembly, where the symbol table is built and used in different stages.  The discussion is geared towards understanding how assemblers manage the mapping between symbolic names (like variable names) and their corresponding memory addresses.
"
58,"This page describes a hashing technique for symbol tables, a common data structure used in computer science.  The text explains how hashing works, its advantages over other methods, and a specific rehashing algorithm.

**Introduction (Paragraphs 1-3):** The initial paragraphs introduce the concept of hashing as a method for placing items (like names) into a table.  It contrasts haphazard placement with a more systematic approach using a hash function.  The text highlights that in a well-designed hash function, the items are distributed more evenly across the table, reducing the likelihood of ""clustering"" (many items in the same section).  It also explains that the hash function takes an input (like a name) and transforms it into an index (a location in the table).

**Hashing vs. Random Placement (Paragraphs 4-6):** The text explains that if names are placed randomly into the table, there's a high chance of clustering, which makes searching for a name much slower.  It contrasts this with the hash function approach, which aims to distribute names more evenly.

**Hash Function and Rehashing (Paragraphs 7-10):** The text describes a hash function as a method to map names to table indices.  It gives an example of a hash function that adds the bytes of a character string together.  It also introduces the concept of rehashing, which is used when a hash function produces a location that's already occupied.  Rehashing involves recalculating the index using a different method or a modified version of the original hash function.

**Algorithm for Rehashing (Paragraphs 11-12):** The text details a specific rehashing algorithm.  It explains how to initialize a variable, shift bits, mask out bits, and add the result to the original hash value to get a new hash value.  This process is repeated until an empty slot is found in the table.

**Performance Analysis (Paragraphs 13-15):** The text discusses the performance of the hashing algorithm.  It highlights that the average number of comparisons needed to find an item in the table depends on how full the table is, not on the size of the table.  It contrasts this with a sequential search method, which takes significantly more comparisons, especially in a nearly full table.

**Illustration and Variations (Paragraphs 16-18):** The text includes a diagram (Figure 8) illustrating the rehashing process.  It also mentions other variations of hashing, such as ""overflow chaining,"" where items that hash to the same location are linked together in a chain.  This method is useful for large tables and dynamic storage allocation.

**Conclusion (Paragraph 19):** The text concludes by noting that the overflow chaining method is less suitable for microcomputers because it requires extra storage.


**Overall:** The page provides a detailed explanation of the hashing technique, including a specific rehashing algorithm, and its advantages over other methods.  It also discusses the performance characteristics of the algorithm and its variations.  The inclusion of a diagram helps visualize the process.
"
59,"This page is a technical document, likely an article or section of a manual, discussing assembly language programming.  It details various features and techniques for writing assembly code, focusing on how to define constants, use symbols, and perform expression evaluation.

**Sections and Topics:**

* **Address Field and Hashing:** The article begins by mentioning address fields and hashing, suggesting a discussion of how symbols are stored and accessed in the assembly process.

* **Defining Constants:** This section explains how assembly languages use pseudo-ops (like FCB) to define constants.
