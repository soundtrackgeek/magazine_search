The style of the artwork is reminiscent of comic books or graphic novels, with a blend of realism and stylized elements.  The character is positioned in a dynamic pose, suggesting action or conflict.

Above and slightly to the left of the main character, there's a smaller illustration of a creature, possibly a troll or a similar mythical being. This creature is depicted in a seated or reclining position, with a rough, textured appearance.  The creature's features are exaggerated, and the style is consistent with the overall fantasy theme.

The lettering and design elements surrounding the artwork suggest a title or a publication identifier.  The words ""SLANE"" are prominently displayed in a stylized font, likely the name of the character or the title of the story.  The words ""the King"" and ""COMMODORE"" are also visible, possibly indicating a series or a specific issue.

* **Vector Graphics:** The reviewer describes the vector graphics as ""good or bad,"" implying a mixed opinion.  While the graphics are a key part of the game, the reviewer finds the gameplay repetitive and frustrating.  The game involves completing eight challenging tasks, but the reviewer feels the story is ""rather inane"" and the gameplay is repetitive, with players often ""floating around"" and searching for planets.  The weapons and enemy locations are also criticized.

* **Gameplay:** The reviewer criticizes the game's pacing and the difficulty in finding planets.  The initial weapons are described as ""pathetic,"" and the player is forced to search for better weapons.

The game is compared to other space games like Elite, but the reviewer feels that Star Fox is a diluted version of those games.  The reviewer finds the game's arcade adventure elements to be too slow and frustrating.
