57,"This page is a preview special from *Amiga Power* magazine, September 1991, featuring Populous II, a game by Electronic Arts.  The page is largely dedicated to a review and preview of the game, along with a separate review of *Mega Lo Mania*.

**Populous II Review:**

The review highlights the evolution from the first *Populous* game.  The reviewer notes that while the game visually resembles the first, significant changes have been made.  The removal of the ""book effect"" backgrounds and the simplification of the backgrounds to a plain black void are emphasized as creating a more focused and god-like feeling of control over the landscape.  The reviewer praises the addition of more effects and improved controls, making the game more action-packed and intuitive.  A key aspect is the increased number of ways to play the game, with no finite end, contrasting with the previous game's more linear experience.  The reviewer also discusses the different gameplay modes, including Conquest (role-playing), Challenge (saving cities from disasters), Problem (solving tasks), and Custom (creating scenarios).  The review also mentions the inclusion of a serial link, two-player mode, rewind feature, and the ability to have multiple computer opponents.

**Mega Lo Mania Review:**

A separate review of *Mega Lo Mania* is presented.  The reviewer notes that while similar in concept to *Populous*, *Mega Lo Mania* has a different feel.  The presentation is less ambitious, focusing on a more straightforward wargame-style approach.  Instead of manipulating settlements, the player leads them in a more direct manner.  The reviewer highlights the game's more accessible controls and the use of digitized voices, which are described as funny and engaging.  The review directs readers to page 22 for a more in-depth look at the game's design philosophy and its differences from *Populous*.  The reviewer quotes John Hare of Sensible Software, who discusses the game's development, emphasizing the shift from a space-shooter-style concept to a more management-focused game with alien animals and robots.

**Overall:**

The page provides a comprehensive preview of both games, highlighting key features, gameplay mechanics, and design philosophies.

The page also includes a rating for *Mega Lo Mania*, though the rating is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

58,"This page is from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, and features a review and preview of several upcoming Amiga games.  The focus is on strategy games, specifically three: Realms, Flag, and Gremlin.

**Realms (Virgin, Available October):**

The review describes Realms as a frantic strategy game, more global in scope than Powermonger.  The game is about inheriting a realm with multiple cities, and managing resources and taxes.  The game features a map view showing strategic links between towns, followed by a closer, more detailed Powermonger-style battle view.  The reviewer notes that the game aims to feel like a real-world conflict, with both player control and random events.  The game's scale, with each on-screen soldier representing 1000 men, is also highlighted.  The reviewer expresses concern that the long development time has led to some annoying timing issues.

**Flag (Available November):**

Flag is described as a 3D isometric strategy game, but different from other games in the genre.  The reviewer notes that the scale of the game is closer to the action than other games like Populous, and the view is more like a Cadaver than a Populous.  The game is a conflict between two tribes, with a maximum of 60 people on each side.  The game is not a large-scale war, but a stealthy operation to steal the other tribe's flag.  The game features a choice between a 3D view and a 2D map view, and the reviewer recommends switching between them during gameplay.  The game is described as an action game, with a short-term strategy focus.  The graphics are reminiscent of old Spectrum games, and the tone is described as fun.

**Gremlin (Available November):**

Gremlin is another 3D isometric strategy game, similar to Realms and Flag.  The reviewer notes that it shares a similar visual style to the other games, but the scale is different, and the game is closer to the action.  The game is described as a similar task to Flag, but the scale is different.  The reviewer notes that the view is closer to the action in Flag than Populous.

**Paintball Approach:**

The page also discusses a ""paintball"" approach, which is a different gameplay mechanic for a strategy game.  This approach is based on conflict between two tribes, with a limited number of people on each side.  The game is not a large-scale war, but a stealthy operation to steal the other tribe's flag.

**Overall:**

The page provides a preview and review of three upcoming Amiga strategy games, highlighting their unique features and gameplay mechanics.  The reviews emphasize the differences between these games and other popular strategy titles, such as Powermonger and Populous.

74,"This page is a section from an Amiga computer magazine, likely from September 1991, featuring game reviews.  It covers three different games:

**1. Living Jigsaws:**

* **Rating:**  The review is negative, giving the game a low score (likely in the 40s or below).
* **Publisher:** Miles Computing
* **Authors:** Peter Fokos, Brian Dixon
* **Price:** Â£24.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review Summary:** The reviewer criticizes the game for being a poor adaptation of a traditional jigsaw puzzle to a computer format.  They find the animated pieces and the overall concept of a computer jigsaw to be uninspired and lacking in appeal.  The reviewer notes that the game is slow and primitive, lacking charm or wit.  They suggest the game is only suitable for very young children.

**2. Battle Chess II - Chinese Chess:**

* **Rating:** The review is negative, giving the game a low score (likely in the 40s or below).
* **Publisher:** Electronic Arts
* **Author:** Greg Christensen
* **Price:** Â£25.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review Summary:** The reviewer criticizes the game for several reasons:  the graphical routines are repetitive and slow; the Chinese Chess itself is not engaging or challenging; the software is poorly designed, making it difficult to control pieces and use the ""suggest move"" option; and the game's overall design is not well-suited to the Amiga platform.  The reviewer suggests that the game is only of novelty value and that players would be better off with other chess games.

**3. Conflict Middle East:**

* **Rating:** The review is positive, though not overwhelmingly so.  The exact rating is not explicitly stated, but the tone suggests a more favorable opinion than the previous two games.
* **Publisher:** SSI/US Gold
* **Author:** Norm Koger
* **Price:** Â£30.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review Summary:** The reviewer praises the game as a well-made wargame, noting that it represents a state-of-the-art approach to the genre.  They highlight the use of a hexagonal map and the handling of movement and combat.  However, the review also notes that the game's ""state-of-the-art"" approach might not be as engaging to players as it once was.

75,"This page is from a magazine, likely an issue of Amiga Power, featuring game reviews and articles.  Specifically, it's a review of a game called ""Swap,"" published by Palace and developed by Microids.

**Review of ""Swap"" (Page 75):**

The review, written by Colin Campbell, gives the game a 59% rating.  The review is quite detailed and critical, highlighting both the positive and negative aspects of the game.

* **Positive aspects:** The review acknowledges the game's simplicity, stating that it takes only a couple of minutes to learn the basic mechanics of swapping shapes to clear the board.  It also mentions the occasional extra features, like cascading shapes when you run out of ideas, and the option to add extra shapes to the grid.

* **Negative aspects:** The review's main criticism is that the game lacks ""interest or intrigue.""  The reviewer feels that the repetitive nature of swapping shapes, without a compelling goal or reward, leads to boredom after a few hours.  The reviewer also points out that the game's reward system is not sufficient to keep players engaged.  The variety of shapes is also criticized as being limited and not enough to keep the game fresh.  The reviewer concludes that the game is suitable only for those who have already exhausted similar puzzle games.

**Other sections on the page:**

* **""Just when good puzzlers seemed to have dried up...""** This is a section introducing the game review. It mentions that the game is one of the few puzzle games released recently.

* **Author and Publisher Information:**  The review includes details about the game's publisher (Palace) and the authors (Microids).

* **""The Bottom Line"" (68%):** This section, written by Sean Masterson, is a separate review or summary of a different game.  It gives the game a 68% rating and describes it as a traditional wargame, but one that feels outdated compared to more sophisticated wargame techniques.

* **""The Bottom Line"" (59%):** This is the second ""Bottom Line"" section, which is a summary of the Swap game review.

* **Artwork and Screenshots:** The page includes several screenshots and diagrams of the game's gameplay, showing the grid of shapes and the mechanics of swapping.

In summary, the page presents a critical review of the puzzle game ""Swap,"" highlighting its simplicity and limited appeal, while also including a separate review of a different game.  The page is formatted with clear headings, graphics, and text to present the information in a visually appealing and informative way.

76,"This page from a magazine features reviews of three different video games: Striker Manager, Billiards II Simulator, and International Championship Athletics.

**Striker Manager:**

* **Rating:**  The review gives a negative rating, summarized in the ""Bottom Line"" as ""terrible soccer management game. Look elsewhere for entertainment.""  The rating is 18%.
* **Publisher:** D&H Games
* **Price:** Â£24.99
* **Author:** John Atkinson
* **Review Summary:** The reviewer criticizes the game's poor management sequences, lack of direction, and repetitive animation.  They find the game's action sequences to be extremely rare and decisions to be ignored.  The animation is described as ""too crap to be laughable, it's just plain sad.""  The results service, which tracks European division results, is deemed irrelevant and impossible to turn off.  The reviewer looks forward to a revamped version of the previous game, Football Director, but expresses concern that the football management genre is heading towards oblivion.

**Billiards II Simulator:**

* **Rating:** The review gives a negative rating, summarized in the ""Bottom Line"" as ""Might just about be okay if there weren't any other 3D pool/snooker games around. But there are, so it's not."" The rating is 47%.
* **Publisher:** Infogrames
* **Price:** Â£25.99
* **Review Summary:** The reviewer criticizes the game's difficulty in lining up shots, particularly in 2D mode.  The shot-strength meter is described as unhelpful, and the table rotation in 3D mode is too large, making accuracy difficult.  The game is deemed silly and awkward to play, lacking a coherent feel.  The reviewer suggests alternative games like Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker or MicroProse's 3D Pool for a better experience.

**International Championship Athletics:**

* **Rating:** The review gives a mixed rating, summarized in the ""Bottom Line"" as ""Terrible presentation, but lots of fun and not a little addictive. There's hours of frenzied joystick waggling here, but even with the game's good points, it's hard to justify the asking price."" The rating is 59%.
* **Publisher:** Hawk
* **Price:** Â£25.99
* **Authors:** In-house
* **Review Summary:** The reviewer acknowledges the game's poor presentation, graphics, and control, but finds it entertaining and addictive.  The reviewer praises the variety of events, but criticizes the 5000-meter race and pole vault as difficult and uninteresting.  The commentator is described as ridiculous and annoying.  The reviewer concludes that while the game is fun, the price is hard to justify given the flaws.
