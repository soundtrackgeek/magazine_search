"
29,"This page contains a technical explanation of the program counter in an 8008-based computer system.  It's likely part of a larger document, as it's labeled ""Fig. 4.""

The text describes the program counter as a group of cells within the CPU that hold a binary value representing the address of a word in memory.  Crucially, the program counter's size (14 bits in this example) allows it to address a much larger number of memory locations than a single word (8 bits in this case).

The explanation delves into how the program counter works with instructions that change its value, allowing the program to jump to different parts of memory.  It highlights the concept of ""paging"" as a way to manage large memory spaces.  Paging divides memory into blocks (pages) of 256 words each, making it easier for programmers to work with memory addresses.  The example shows how a programmer might refer to a word in memory as being on a specific page, even though the machine internally uses a different, absolute address.

The text emphasizes that the program counter's value is not directly equivalent to the physical memory address of a word.  The program counter's value is used to locate the next instruction in memory, and the machine handles the translation to the actual physical memory address.

The text also explains how the program counter can be updated by reading multiple memory words, and how the unused parts of a memory word can be discarded.

Finally, the page mentions the central processing unit (CPU) and its role in controlling the program counter's function.  It notes that the program counter's primary function is to track the location of the next instruction in memory.

38,"This page is a description of a game called HEXPAWN, presented as a beginning project in Artificial Intelligence.

The top section introduces the game and its context within the field of AI.  It includes a diagram of a chessboard with pieces arranged in a way that suggests the game's mechanics.

The text then delves into a discussion of what constitutes intelligence in a program.  It argues against purely philosophical or psychological definitions, instead proposing an operational definition: an ""intelligent"" program is one designed to handle a range of circumstances, with rules for successful and unsuccessful responses, and a memory of past interactions.  The text cites an example of a simple game application as an illustration of this definition.  It also acknowledges the inherent unpredictability and uniqueness of AI program outputs, comparing them to the variability of human behavior.

The page then presents the rules of HEXPAWN.  The rules are described as simple, mirroring the movement of a chess pawn.  Players aim to move their pieces to the opposite side of the board or block the opponent's pieces.  The only allowed moves are one square forward to an unoccupied square, or one square diagonally to ""take"" an opponent's piece.  Crucially, diagonal movement is only permitted if it results in capturing an opponent's piece.  A diagram (Figure 1) is referenced to illustrate a typical game situation, showing occupied and unoccupied squares.  The text emphasizes that the computer (represented by X) can move in two ways, one of which involves capturing a human pawn (represented by O), while the other does not.

Finally, the page concludes with a note directing the reader to the original article for a complete explanation and a statement that this version of HEXPAWN is a learning game.  It also encourages readers to check their local libraries for Scientific American.

48,"This page is a technical article, likely from a publication like *Byte*, discussing a digital feedback loop for an oscilloscope.  The article is a report by Sumner S. Loomis, proprietor of Loomis Laboratories.

**Title:** The Digital Feedback Loop

**Content:**

The article details Loomis's modifications to a Hogenson oscilloscope graphics display design.  He used a preliminary version of a PC board for the scope display, but instead of using TTL integrated circuits, he used CMOS.  The article includes Loomis's observations and findings regarding the modifications.

**Specific Observations and Findings:**

* **R1 and R2 Pot Adjustment:** Loomis found that adjusting resistors R1 and R2 could cause the DACs (IC15 and IC16) to overheat.  He theorizes this is because of a slight overlap in the digital ramp (bit 4 is off value).  He recommends setting these pots at maximum resistance initially and adjusting them while observing the output ramp on an oscilloscope until the maximum height ramp is achieved without clipping.

* **CMOS Implementation:** The switch to CMOS was successful and resulted in a lower power drain and logic swings from rail-to-rail.  The specific IC substitutions are detailed:
    * IC1 becomes 74C10
    * IC2 becomes 74C04
    * IC3 becomes 74C00
    * IC4 becomes 74C00
    * IC5 uses 7408 TTL (no 74C equivalent)
    * IC6 becomes 74C155
    * IC7-IC10 become 74C193

* **Z-Axis Op Amp:** Loomis notes the need to change the Z-axis op amp in the display unit to accommodate the high-frequency drive.  The existing amplifier is too slow, causing smearing of dots and low brightness on individual dots.

* **Figures:** The article includes two figures:
    * **Figure 1:** Shows staircase ramp waveforms for X and Y drives.  This figure illustrates the stepping of the X and Y drive DAC outputs during several sweeps of the display.
    * **Figure 2:** Depicts a full raster achieved by turning on the scan and disconnecting the Z modulation input from the scope.

**Overall:**

The article presents a practical, hands-on approach to modifying an oscilloscope.  Loomis's detailed observations and findings provide valuable insights into the design and implementation of the digital feedback loop.
