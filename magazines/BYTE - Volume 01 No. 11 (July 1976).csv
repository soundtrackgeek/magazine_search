"
9,"This page contains a technical description, likely from a textbook or technical document, about the magnetic properties of ferrite cores.  It's discussing how the magnetic field (B) within a core changes in response to an applied magnetic field (H), which is often related to an electric current.

**Section Breakdown:**

* **Introduction (Paragraphs 1-2):**  The text introduces the concept of magnetic induction (B) and its relationship to the applied magnetic field (H) within a material, specifically a ferrite core. It explains that the presence of the core significantly alters the magnetic field compared to a situation without the core.  It also mentions the existence of microscopic magnetic domains within the core material.

* **Figure 2 Explanation:** This figure illustrates how the direction of the magnetic induction (B) within the core aligns with the applied magnetic field (H) due to the current.  The diagrams show the core's internal structure and how the magnetic domains within the core respond to the external field.

* **Core Magnetization and Demagnetization (Paragraphs 3-5):** The text describes how the core's magnetization changes as the applied field (H) is increased and decreased.  It explains that the core's magnetic field strength (B) is proportional to the current (i) in the wire.  The text details the process of magnetization (increasing H) and demagnetization (decreasing H), noting that the core retains some magnetization even when the applied field is removed.

* **Figure 3 Explanation (Hysteresis):** This figure is a crucial part of the explanation. It's a graph (B vs. H) showing the hysteresis loop.  The loop demonstrates the core's memory effect.  The loop shows how the core's magnetic field (B) doesn't simply follow the applied field (H) in a linear fashion.  Instead, it traces a specific path (the hysteresis loop) as the applied field is varied.  The loop shows the residual magnetization (B) remaining in the core even when the applied field (H) is zero.  The text explains that this ""memory"" effect is called hysteresis.  The figure also shows how the positive and negative values of H and B correspond to different directions of rotation around the core axis.

**Overall:**

The page is focused on explaining the behavior of a ferrite core under varying magnetic fields.  It uses diagrams and graphs to illustrate the concepts, making the explanation more accessible and easier to understand. The text is technical but clear, explaining the underlying physics of the phenomenon.  The review rating is not present, as this is not a review but rather a technical explanation.
"
10,"This page contains information about magnetic core memory, focusing on the principles of how data is stored and retrieved.  It's likely an excerpt from a technical document or textbook.

The page is divided into several sections, each with diagrams and explanations.

**Figure 4: Sense Voltages Perceived on a Wire:** This section illustrates how the voltage changes on a wire passing through a magnetic core are related to the core's magnetic state.  It shows two scenarios: one where the core's magnetic field doesn't change (non-switching), and one where it does (switching).  The diagrams show the applied current and the resulting voltage changes in the sense wire.  The text explains that the voltage difference is proportional to the change in the core's magnetic field (B) and inversely proportional to the time it takes for that change to occur.  This is crucial for the speed and efficiency of the memory.  The text also highlights the concept of reversibility and irreversibility in the core's response to magnetic fields.

**Sensing Core Magnetism Changes:** This section explains how changes in the core's magnetic field are detected.  It describes how the voltage difference across a second wire passing through the core is proportional to the change in the core's magnetic field.  The text emphasizes the importance of speed in generating signals, as fast changes produce larger signals, but also notes that reversible changes can also produce large signals.  The text also discusses the difference between microscopic realignments and larger-scale deformations in the core's magnetic structure.

**Using the Core to Remember:** This section describes how data is stored and retrieved.  It introduces the concept of representing a binary ""0"" or ""1"" by the initial direction of the magnetic field (B) in the core.  The diagrams (Figure 5) show the four basic operations: reading a ""0"", reading a ""1"", writing a ""0"", and writing a ""1"".  These operations are explained in terms of the core's magnetic field switching.

**Figure 5:** This figure provides a visual representation of the four basic operations for manipulating the binary state of a magnetic core memory.  It shows how the direction of the magnetic field (B) in the core is used to represent a ""0"" or a ""1"", and how the core can be manipulated to read and write these values.

**Overall:** The page provides a detailed explanation of the physics behind magnetic core memory, focusing on the core's response to magnetic fields, the detection of changes in those fields, and the use of these principles for storing and retrieving binary data.  The diagrams and explanations are crucial for understanding the technical details.
"
11,"This page contains technical information, likely from a document about memory storage, focusing on a method using hysteresis and coincident current selection.

**Figure 6:** This figure illustrates how hysteresis in a core material allows for coincident current bit selection.  Three diagrams show different states of a core with respect to applied current (1/2 and full current).  A graph shows the hysteresis curve, illustrating how different current levels affect the core's magnetic field (B) and the applied magnetic field (H).  The text explains that a current of 'i' is sufficient to change the core's state, while a current of 'i/2' is not.  Two currents of 'i/2' in the same direction are equivalent to a single 'i' current.  The figure demonstrates how the core's state can be controlled by the combined effect of multiple currents.

**Text accompanying Figure 6:** The text describes how the core's reversibility property is used to assist in selection.  It explains that passing two independently controlled current lines through a core, each carrying half the current of a single line, allows for selective switching.  If only one line passes half the current, the core returns to its original state.  If both lines pass current, the core switches only if it's in the correct initial state.  This is analogous to an AND gate, where both inputs must be present for the output to be activated.

**Memories Larger Than One Bit:** This section discusses how the method described in Figure 5 can be used for larger memory arrays.  It notes that storing a large number of bits (e.g., 4096) requires more complex circuitry to select individual cores.  The text explains that the core selection circuitry can be simplified by using the reversibility property of the cores, reducing the amount of selection circuitry needed.

**Coincidence Current Selection:** This section explains how coincident currents are used to select specific cores in a larger array.  It describes how the core acts as an AND gate, requiring both currents to be present simultaneously to activate the core.

**Figure 7:** This figure illustrates the concept of coincident current selection in a larger array.  It shows a grid of cores with X and Y selection lines.  The intersection of an X and Y line addresses a specific core.  The figure demonstrates how a single sense wire can read or write to the addressed core.  The text emphasizes that actual core arrays are much larger than the example shown.

**Overall:** The page describes a method for selecting and manipulating individual cores in a memory array using coincident current selection and the reversibility property of the core material.  The figures and text provide a detailed explanation of the principles involved.  The focus is on efficient memory selection in larger systems.
"
12,"This page contains technical information, likely from a document or manual, about a 3D core memory system.  It describes the design, operation, and limitations of the memory architecture.

The text is divided into sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the memory.

**Property and Operation Restrictions:** This section details the constraints imposed on the memory's design by the coincidence current mode.  It explains how the half-select current must generate a magnetic field (H) below a certain threshold (Hk) to prevent unwanted switching, while the full select current must exceed another threshold (Hs) to ensure proper switching.  The difference between these thresholds (Hs - Hk) is crucial for the memory's operation and is limited by manufacturing tolerances.  The text also notes that the operating range is further restricted by manufacturing tolerances and the tendency of the cores to heat up during operation, which affects the magnetic characteristics (B vs H curve).

**Figures 8 and 9:** These figures illustrate the concepts discussed in the text. Figure 8 shows a graph relating current to magnetic field strength, highlighting the critical tolerance range for select currents. Figure 9 depicts the core array, showing the ""inhibit line"" added to the assembly.  This inhibit line is designed to prevent unwanted state changes in cores when multiple selection lines are active.

**Reading and Writing Words: The 3D Memory:** This section describes the memory's addressing scheme.  It explains how the coincidence current method selects specific cores, although it comes with limitations on operating tolerances.  The text discusses how 20 cores are selected by 9 lines, and how a larger memory (4096 bits) can be organized in a 64x64 array using only 128 select lines.  The section also explores the concept of word-organized memories, using examples like a 16-bit array and a 16-word memory with 3 bits per word.  It shows how multiple planes of cores can be interconnected to achieve larger memory capacities.

**Overall:** The page provides a detailed technical description of a 3D core memory system, emphasizing the design trade-offs between achieving high memory capacity and maintaining reliable operation.  The text is focused on the physical principles and practical limitations of the technology.  There are no explicit review ratings or opinions expressed.

**Figure 10: 3D Plane Interconnections:**  The figure visually depicts the 3-dimensional arrangement of memory planes.  It shows how X and Y lines connect between planes to address a specific bit within the 3D structure.  Crucially, only two lines are shown connected in each X and Y direction in the diagram, implying that other connections exist but are not explicitly illustrated for clarity.  The figure highlights the concept of implicit 3D addressing, where the X, Y, and Z (or plane) coordinates are used to locate a specific memory bit.

**Text Description:** The accompanying text explains the operation of the 3D memory.  It describes how data is written and read, emphasizing the use of ""half select"" currents to control the writing process.  The text also discusses the concept of ""interconnection"" between planes, using the analogy of ""pancakes"" to illustrate the stacking of memory arrays.  Key aspects include:

* **Writing Data:**  A 1 is written by applying a current to the appropriate select lines.  A 0 is written by applying a half-select current to the inhibit lines, effectively canceling the write current at the desired location.
* **Noise Minimization:**  The text details strategies to reduce noise in the system.  It discusses how the arrangement of select, sense, and inhibit lines can be optimized to minimize noise from core switching and capacitive coupling.  The use of parallel select lines and diagonal patterns to cancel out noise pulses is highlighted.
* **Core Orientation:**  The text notes that core orientation within a plane can affect noise levels.
* **3D Memory Variations:**  The text mentions variations of the 3D memory architecture, including a variation that combines inhibit and sense lines into a single line, which simplifies the circuitry but introduces additional complexity.
* **Other Arrangements:**  The text briefly discusses alternative memory architectures, such as 2D memories, and notes that the 22D scheme is not discussed due to its complex circuitry.
* **Driving the 3D Memory:**  This section discusses the half-select current tolerances and how the inhibit line can reduce these tolerances to less than 20% per line.  It also mentions that the amplitude of the core switch signal depends on the total select current.

**Overall:** The page provides a detailed technical description of a 3D memory system, focusing on its design, operation, and the challenges of minimizing noise.  The diagrams and text work together to explain the complex interactions within the memory architecture.  There's no explicit review rating, but the content suggests a technical discussion of a memory design.

The page details three methods for creating the negative patterns used in photo etching:

* **""Cut-N-Peel"" Method (Photo 4):** A sheet of red mylar film with a clear acetate backing is placed over the desired pattern.  The pattern is traced with a razor or sharp knife, removing the red mylar where component pads and connections are to be made.  The negative is then transferred to sensitized copper and etched.  The trade name for the film is ""Rubylith.""

* **Bishop Graphics ""B' Neg"" Method (Photo 5):**  A negative is created directly using self-adhesive black patterns on a mylar backing.  Connections between patterns are made by cutting away the black layer with a sharp knife, similar to the ""Cut-N-Peel"" method.

* **Direct Resist Method:** This method is described as less efficient for multiple boards, but faster for a single board.  It involves applying a resist solution directly to the copper board, protecting the areas that should not be etched.

**Photo Etching Process (General):**

The page explains the general photo etching process, regardless of the specific method used:

1. **Sensitization:** The copper-clad board is coated with a photo-sensitive etch resist.

2. **Exposure:** The sensitized board is placed over a negative of the desired pattern and exposed to ultraviolet light for a specific time.

3. **Development:** The board is immersed in a resist developer solution, removing the light-sensitive resist from the areas not protected by the negative.

4. **Etching:** The board is etched, removing the unprotected copper.

5. **Resist Removal:** The remaining resist is removed.

6. **Assembly:** The board can then be cut, drilled, and assembled.

**Comparison of Photo Resist and Direct Resist:**

The page highlights the difference between photo resist and direct resist methods.  Photo resist is generally more efficient for multiple boards, while direct resist is faster for a single board.

**Making Negatives:**

The page concludes by emphasizing the simplicity of using reusable negatives for photo etching, as opposed to manually recreating the pattern each time.

The page provides a detailed explanation of different photo etching methods, emphasizing the steps involved and the advantages of each approach.  It's a technical document, likely from a manual or textbook, aimed at those working with printed circuit boards.
"
63,"This page describes various methods for creating negative patterns for printed circuit boards (PCBs).  It's likely an excerpt from a technical manual or guide.

The text discusses several methods, including:

* **""Cut-N-Peel"" method:** Suitable for simpler patterns, this involves cutting out the desired pattern from a red film on a clear acetate backing.  The red film is then peeled away, leaving a negative pattern.  This method becomes more complex for integrated circuits.

* **""B' Neg"" method:**  A more suitable method for integrated circuits, this involves using pre-made negative component patterns laid out on a mylar sheet.  Areas between components are covered with black acetate film.

* **Traditional Photo Negative Method:** This method creates a positive artwork pattern using pre-printed self-adhesive patterns and artwork tape.  A sharp knife is used to cut the tape, and a photographic process inverts the image to create a negative.  A diagram (Photo 6) illustrates the process, showing someone applying the pattern to a mylar sheet.

* **Positive Artwork:**  The text emphasizes creating a positive pattern first, then using photographic methods to create a negative.  This positive artwork is often made on clear mylar film with a matte finish.  The artwork patterns are available in various sizes and shapes.

* **Photography Without a Darkroom:**  This section describes a method that doesn't require a darkroom.  A special reversing film is used, which can be handled in subdued light or a darkened room with dim yellow light.  The positive pattern is placed directly on top of the film.

* **Datak Film Method:**  This method is more involved, using Datak film and developing solutions.  It allows for various transformations, including creating negatives from positives, positives from negatives, and copies from existing printed circuit patterns.  The text notes that exposure and developing times are more critical with this method.

The patch is presented as a series of BASIC code snippets.

**Section 2: How to Do It Better:**

This section is a letter from Michael M. Dodd, offering feedback and suggestions on a different article in the same issue, ""Controlling External Devices With Hobbyist Computers"" by Robert Bosen.  Dodd's letter is structured as a critique of the hardware design, pointing out potential flaws and suggesting better approaches.

**Review Rating:**

There isn't a numerical rating, but Dodd's letter highlights several ""Oops"" and ""Point"" issues, indicating areas where the original design could be improved.  The ""Good point"" comments suggest areas where the design is sound or where the author has a valid approach.

**Detailed Description of Dodd's Feedback:**

Dodd's letter covers several points:

* **IC Inverting Bit (D4):**  He criticizes the use of a 7400 instead of a 7404 for the inverting bit, noting the incorrect pin numbers.  He also points out that paralleling TTL gates is generally not good practice and that splitting the load is a better approach if more drive is needed.
* **TTL Output Driving Transistors:**  He notes that driving transistors with TTL outputs can cause overheating due to excessive current draw.
* **Jumpering Scheme:**  He identifies a flawed jumpering scheme in the circuit diagram that could short the address bus lines.
* **Address Loading:**  He suggests a better way to save address loading using low-power TTL, which is a more efficient approach.
* **Relay Diode:**  He explains that a Zener diode isn't necessary across the relay coil, and a standard silicon diode is sufficient to protect the transistor from spikes.
* **Software Considerations:**  He points out that the ""clear"" line on bit D4 is active low, which is a common design choice. He also notes that the software description for toggling a flip-flop is unnecessary, as the chip enable inputs handle this function.
* **General Design Principles:**  Dodd's letter emphasizes good design practice, such as avoiding parallel TTL gates and using active-high signals where appropriate.

The overall tone of Dodd's letter is constructive criticism, offering practical advice and suggestions for improvement.  The use of ""Oops,"" ""Point,"" and ""Good point"" labels helps categorize the feedback.
