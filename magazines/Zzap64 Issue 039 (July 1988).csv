The review is presented in a structured format, with different sections evaluating various aspects of the game.

**Game Overview:** The review begins by describing the game's premise: a trainee sorcerer must defeat seven powerful magicians to become the chief wizard. The game is played in three multi-loaded stages, each involving combat with 30 different monster types, ranging from weak wasps to powerful sorceresses.  The player uses spells (fireball, wall of stone, etc.) and must manage three status levels (mental, physical, and spiritual) for both the player and the monsters.  The game features a scrolling landscape, and towns are used to replenish lost energy.

**Gameplay Analysis:** The reviewer highlights the game's role-playing elements, noting the selection of 44 enemies and 8 spells.  However, the reviewer criticizes the game's presentation, particularly the on-screen display.  The graphics are described as ""abysmal,"" with ""jerky scrolling,"" ""minuscule sprites,"" and ""uninspired use of color.""  The sound effects are also deemed weak and repetitive, while the title theme is considered acceptable.  The reviewer points out that the game map is too small, making navigation difficult.  A significant flaw is that spells cannot be replenished after use, leading to a frustrating experience.  The reviewer also notes that the game's terrain doesn't affect the player's movement in a meaningful way.

**Review Ratings:** The review provides specific ratings for different aspects of the game, using percentages:

* **Presentation:** 32% -  The instructions are good, but the unattractive and indistinct screen display ruins the action.
* **Graphics:** 18% - Jerky scrolling, minuscule sprites, and uninspired use of color throughout.
* **Sound:** 44% - The sound effects are simple and soon grate, but the title theme is OK.
* **Hookability:** 26% - Wandering around is uninteresting and the action is clumsy, but the combat sequences are sometimes enjoyable.
* **Lastability:** 41% - If you ignore the awful presentation, the task is both large and challenging.
* **Overall:** 30% - A very poor interpretation of an excellent concept.

**Additional Details:** The review also describes the final stage of the game, where the player faces the seven Mages in order from Wolf Lord to Dragon Lord.  Each wizard is protected by their familiars, and defeating them increases the player's attributes.

44,"This page is a review of two SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.) strategy games, ""Gemstone Healer"" and ""Panzer Grenadiers,"" from a 1988 issue of ZZAP! magazine.  The review, written by Philippa Irving, gives a detailed look at the gameplay, graphics, and overall experience of ""Gemstone Healer.""

**Gemstone Healer Review:**

The review begins by noting the game's ""pseudo-roleplaying"" nature, positioning it between pure strategy and arcade adventure games.  The reviewer highlights the puzzle-solving elements and decision-making required to progress, contrasting this with games that rely heavily on character statistics.

The review describes the game's visual presentation, focusing on the large action panel that displays the underground environment.  The adventurer is a small figure, and the exits from rooms are clearly marked.  The reviewer notes the lack of significant features in the rooms beyond the essential elements.  The inventory screen displays the magic items, splitting tools, and gemstone fragments.  The game's 14 magic items are described, including the ""Ancient Black Thing"" illusion item.

The reviewer points out the game's similarity to ""Gauntlet"" in terms of monster movement and combat, but notes that the monsters are not overly numerous or difficult.  The game's objective is to find splitting tools, fragment the gemstone, and use healing tools to mend the fragments.  The reviewer emphasizes the need to prepare a map disk, which is a somewhat tedious but necessary part of the game.

The review also discusses the game's map generation process, which is random based on the disk name.  The reviewer notes that the game generates a new dungeon each time, and the process takes several minutes.  The game is not a traditional role-playing game, as the character is pre-built and ready to go.

The reviewer describes the monsters and their characteristics, including their sounds and the way they appear on the screen.  The best way to defeat them is to use the crossbow.

The review concludes with a positive assessment of the game's gameplay, noting its satisfying puzzle elements, entertaining combat, and the potential for extended play.  The reviewer expresses appreciation for the map generation process, which avoids the tedium of repetitive dungeon layouts.  The reviewer also acknowledges the game's simplicity in terms of graphics and plot, but finds the gameplay engaging nonetheless.

**Overall Rating:**

While the review doesn't explicitly state a numerical rating, the tone suggests a positive, if not enthusiastic, experience with the game.  The reviewer finds the game engaging and entertaining, despite some minor criticisms.

* **Overall:** The overall rating is 32%.

68,"This page is a review of two video games, ""Thrust II"" and ""Brainstorm,"" published in ZZAP! magazine, July 1988.  The review is spread across multiple sections, each dedicated to a different aspect of the games.

**Thrust II Review:**

The review begins with a description of the gameplay mechanics of Thrust II.  The player must collect musical components in protective orbs within three planets (Stick, Aching, and Walkman) by towing them to the surface.  The objective is to defeat the Cories, an evil empire, by completing a machine that proves fatal to them.  The game uses a joystick or keys for control, and contact with enemies or aliens results in shield loss.  All shields lost mean the game ends.

The reviewer, a ""hardened Thrust veteran,"" expresses disappointment with the sequel.  They criticize the game's less realistic physical forces and less tortuous reaction tests compared to the original.  While acknowledging improved graphics, the reviewer questions whether the game has the lasting appeal of its predecessor.  The review highlights the game's score, timer, shields, and agent information displayed on the screen.

**Brainstorm Review:**

The review of Brainstorm focuses on its gameplay, graphics, sound, and overall appeal.  The objective is to trap moving balls on a grid using colored lines.  The game features 26 screens, different skill levels, and a scoring system based on lines and bonus switches.  The reviewer notes the game's simple concept of trapping a bouncing ball with three lines, but emphasizes how this simplicity becomes incredibly challenging on later screens.  The reviewer praises the game's graphics as ""blocky and colourful,"" but the sound is described as basic in-game bashing sounds.

**Presentation, Graphics, Sound, Hookability, and Lastability:**

The review section includes detailed scores for presentation, graphics, sound, hookability, and lastability for both games.  For Thrust II, the presentation is rated 63%, graphics 67%, sound 75%, hookability 67%, and lastability 43%.  The reviewer notes the title screen's attractiveness but criticizes the inadequate instructions.  The graphics are described as varying from gaudy backdrops to well-animated sprites.  The sound is a lengthy Heavy Metal soundtrack.  The hookability is only rescued by the depth and appeal of the task.  The lastability is low, as the thin scenario and lack of real action soon repel interest.

For Brainstorm, the presentation is rated 89%, graphics 38%, sound 23%, hookability 90%, and lastability 92%.  The reviewer praises the three difficulty levels, high-score table, and the option to begin on any five screens.  The graphics are described as simple, blocky, and colourful.  The sound is basic in-game bashing sounds.  The hookability is high, as the simplicity makes it easy to pick up and impossible to put down.  The lastability is high, as the three difficulty levels and 26 screens guarantee further plays.

**Overall Scores:**

The overall scores for both games are also provided.  Thrust II receives an overall score of 59%, described as a reasonable and occasionally flawed game, but a very poor sequel.  Brainstorm receives an overall score of 94%, described as an immediately compelling and fiendishly addictive addition to the puzzle genre.

**Storm Bringer Review:**

* **Presentation:** 67% - The review notes the selection system is comprehensive but convoluted in practice.
* **Graphics:** 68% - Cartoonesque characters vary in quality, but backgrounds are generally good.
* **Sound:** 80% - A good electro-bop soundtrack.
* **Hookability:** 62% - Moderate adventuring urges, but the command selection system is long-winded.
* **Lastability:** 72% - Many puzzles to solve, but the menu system can be challenging.
* **Overall:** 70% -  Not the most outstanding game in the Magic Knight series, but it should appeal to fans of the series.

The review criticizes the game's sometimes clumsy commands, requiring multiple sub-menus for actions.  It also notes the game's graphic style is similar to its predecessor, ""Spellbound,"" and that the Windovision system is somewhat intrusive.  The reviewer suggests the game might appeal to fans of adventure and arcade games who enjoyed the original, but not necessarily to those who didn't.

**Pro Golf Review:**

* **Rating:** The overall rating for ""Pro Golf"" is 24%.
* **Presentation:** 59% - The ability to alter game parameters doesn't improve the game's boredom.
* **Graphics:** 25% - Gaudy and indistinct backdrops and sprites with little variety.
* **Sound:** 7% - Some screeching and whining sound effects.
* **Hookability:** 35% - The awkward control method makes the gameplay tedious.
* **Lastability:** 20% - If you own other Leaderboard series games, you likely won't want to play this one.
* **Overall:** 24% - An overpriced and uninteresting budget golf simulation.

The review criticizes the game's overhead perspective, stating it doesn't convey a real feeling of being on the course.  The shot selection method is deemed tiresome, and the graphics and sound are described as merely functional and annoying, respectively.  The reviewer suggests that other, better golf simulations are available for a similar price.  The action is described as dull, despite the game's visual presentation.
