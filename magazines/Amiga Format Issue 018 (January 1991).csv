The article is structured as a collection of short, individual predictions from different programmers.  Each programmer's viewpoint is presented in a separate section, with a brief introduction and their own predictions.

**Section 1: Psygnosis In-House Development Team:**

This section presents the predictions of the Psygnosis team.  They predict that computer games will continue to evolve, but the core genres (shoot-em-ups, strategy, simulation) will remain.  They also believe the Amiga will remain a significant platform, though there might be a transition period.  Their long-term vision is for games to become less isolating and more family-oriented, moving from bedrooms to living rooms.

**Section 2: Ian Andrew Incentive:**

Ian Andrew predicts that games will become more sophisticated and take longer to develop, primarily due to the rise of consoles.  He believes this will lead to more thoughtful Amiga games, leveraging the keyboard's flexibility to create more complex experiences.  He notes that the Amiga's 500K capacity might limit the appeal of larger games, but that porting games from other platforms (like the ST) will continue.

**Section 3: Glynn Williams of Warhead:**

Glynn Williams is optimistic about the Amiga's future. He views the Amiga as a superior 16-bit machine compared to the Sega Megadrive.  He anticipates the Amiga will remain a viable platform, and that the market won't polarize entirely around Nintendo and PC games.  He also predicts a need for a middle ground in the gaming market.  He envisions a future where the world is more like a science fiction novel, with flying cars and neon signs, and even suggests that artificial intelligence might become a significant issue.

**Section 4: Archer McLean of IK+:**

Archer McLean's predictions focus on the shifting market towards consoles and PCs, but he believes the Amiga will persist.  He anticipates the big software houses will continue to produce major games for the Amiga.  He also sees a potential resurgence of simpler puzzle games with improved graphics.  He emphasizes the importance of addictiveness and simple solutions in game design.  He also has a vision of a peaceful world with space travel and transportation advancements.

93,"This page is a review of the video game ""Ranx,"" published in *Amiga Format* magazine, January 1991, issue 93.  The review is by Martin Tompkins and gives the game a 52% rating.

The page features a detailed description of the game, including screenshots, and a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins with a description of the game's premise, set in a fantastical land where a cybernetic character named Ranx, with a large problem (blue lipstick!), must save the world from a strange illness.  The game involves punching, kicking, and using grenades.

**Comic Element:**

The review highlights the game's strong comic book-style graphics, which are described as colorful and immediately engaging.  However, the review criticizes the poor scrolling and jerky movement of the sprites, which are large but not well-integrated into the background.  The review also notes the presence of ""ladies of dubious profession"" and other comic elements, which are likely to be offensive to some players.

**Sound and Music:**

The sound design is praised as excellent, with an unusual guitar tune during the intro and various sound effects, including the ""smashing windows,"" ""cars driving off,"" and ""chainsaw buzz.""  The review particularly notes the effective use of ambient sounds in areas like subway stations and hotels, which create a sense of atmosphere.

**Gameplay:**

The review describes Ranx's limited attack options (punch, high-kick, and low-kick) as a drawback, making the game's ""action"" driver feel less dynamic.  The game's plot is criticized as lacking depth, with little to discover beyond the basic storyline.  The review also notes the irritatingly limited icon system and the repetitive nature of many game sequences.

**Verdict:**

The overall verdict is mixed.  While the game's outrageous, adult humor and brilliant use of background sound are praised, the average sprites, poor scrolling, limited icon system, and repetitive scenes are significant weaknesses.  The review concludes that the game has too many similar scenes and too few fighting moves to hold the player's attention for long.

**Additional Information:**

The page also includes a brief description of the game's ""Comic Element,"" which details the graphics, characters, and storyline.  There's also a section on the game's ""Screenplay,"" showing a screenshot of the game in action.

The review, written by Neil Jackson, gives the game a 74% rating.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing the game's premise:  ATF II is a flight simulator set in the 21st century, featuring a new aircraft, the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF).  Players must complete missions, attacking ground, sea, and air targets, against a dynamic enemy force that grows in size and complexity as the game progresses.  The game is described as being more focused on the aircraft's capabilities than the detailed realism of previous flight sims.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

The review highlights the game's control scheme, which uses a joystick and mouse.  The control panel is described as containing all the necessary functions for ground strikes, including speed control, terrain following, and target selection.  The game's missile lock-on system is explained, emphasizing the diamond overlay on the HUD to indicate a successful lock.  The review also notes the simplicity of the gameplay compared to the detail of F-16 Combat Pilot, with less complex systems.  The enemy is described as having two forms: fighter planes and ground-based artillery.  The game's approach from similar directions is noted as allowing for predictable missile paths.

**Graphics and Sound:**

The review describes the graphics as using a combination of 3D-filled vector graphics and bitmap sprites, resulting in a smooth but not entirely convincing visual style.  The graphics are compared to Falcon, F-29, and F-16, and to road-race games.  The sound is described as a basic, solid theme reminiscent of Thunderbirds/Top Gun, but lacking in the thrill of the action.  The sound effects are described as standard machine-gun, engine whine, and rumbling explosions.

**Verdict:**

The review concludes with a verdict section, which is divided into bullet points.  The reviewer states that while the game is enjoyable for the first few games, the interest will wane.  The game is compared to Space Harrier, suggesting that fans of that game might enjoy ATF II, but that those who enjoyed F-16 Combat Pilot might be disappointed.  The reviewer recommends the game for those who enjoyed Space Harrier but not for those who enjoyed F-16 Combat Pilot.

This contrasts with other methods that might use polygons or facets.  The article highlights the mathematical functions used to define these shapes.

* **Comparison to RenderMan:**  The review contrasts Real 3D with RenderMan, a popular 3D modeling standard for the Macintosh.  It points out that RenderMan uses a different file format (RIB) and a more sophisticated approach to defining surface qualities (shaders).  The article notes that RenderMan is a complete system, including software and tools, while Real 3D is a package.

* **RenderMan's Capabilities:** The article describes RenderMan's capabilities in detail, including its ability to define surface qualities like color, light, texture, and transparency.  It also mentions the use of a material requester for defining materials in RenderMan.

* **Real 3D's Capabilities:** The article describes Real 3D's capabilities, emphasizing its ability to create smooth curved surfaces.  It also highlights the tools for creating complex objects by combining simpler shapes.

* **Camera and Viewing:** The article discusses the virtual camera in both systems, noting that RenderMan's camera is more sophisticated, allowing for variable lenses and exposures.  Real 3D's camera is described as simpler.

* **Impact on the Market:** The article discusses the potential impact of both systems on the Amiga market, noting that RenderMan is already popular on the Macintosh.  It also mentions that Real 3D is a step forward in Amiga 3D modeling.

* **Tool Power:** A section titled ""Tool Power"" describes the tools available in Real 3D to help users create complex objects.

The article concludes with a brief overview of Real 3D's capabilities and a comparison to RenderMan.  There's also a smaller box that highlights the review package itself.
