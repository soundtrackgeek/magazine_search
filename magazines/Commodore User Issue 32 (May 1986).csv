46,"This page from a Commodore User magazine features reviews of two video games, ""Space Escort: Atlantis"" and ""Panik: Atlantis,"" for the Commodore 64.

**Space Escort: Atlantis**

* **Rating:** The review gives a generally positive assessment of the game, awarding it 3 stars for Graphics, Sound, and Toughness, and 4 stars for Staying Power and Value.
* **Description:** The review praises the game's fast-paced, addictive nature, typical of classic arcade shoot-em-ups.  It highlights the scrolling gameplay, where the player must guide a spaceship through space, dodging various enemy ships.  The reviewer notes the presence of different enemy types (Space Flies, Spheroids, etc.) and the use of shields (White = 0, Green = 2, Blue = 3, and Red = 4 or more) to help the player survive.  A key feature mentioned is the ability to continue from a previous game state.  The reviewer also points out the game's high difficulty, especially when facing multiple enemies, and the somewhat lengthy explosion effects.  The review concludes by noting the game's relatively low price (£2.99) compared to other games and commends the game's entertainment value.

**Panik: Atlantis**

* **Rating:** The review gives a mixed assessment, awarding 3 stars for Graphics and Sound, and 4 stars for Toughness, Staying Power, and Value.
* **Description:** The review describes ""Panik"" as a platform and ladder game, but criticizes its lack of quality compared to other games in the same price range.  The player controls a character with a red cap who uses a shovel to defeat monsters.  The gameplay involves digging holes to trap monsters and hitting them on the head with the shovel.  The reviewer notes that the monsters transform into sacks and then long-legged monsters as the game progresses, making the later levels more challenging.  A significant criticism is the repetitive nature of the levels, with the reviewer stating that the next level is virtually identical to the previous one.  The review also mentions the game's limited replay value due to the lack of significant variation in the gameplay.  Despite the criticisms, the reviewer acknowledges the game's decent level design and decent value for the price (£2.99).

**Overall:**

The page presents two separate reviews, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.  The reviews are written in a style typical of a gaming magazine from the 1980s, focusing on gameplay mechanics, difficulty, and value for money.

**Review Content:**

The reviewer, Mike Pattenden, begins by describing the game's premise as a typical platform game, but with a unique element: a ""transporter"" character.  He notes the game's graphics are pixelated and chunky, which he dislikes.  The reviewer also points out a strange aspect of the game's design: the hero character has a large nose, as do the enemies.  He speculates that the game's name, ""Bongo,"" might be related to the length of the game's music, which he suggests is too long for the Commodore 16's memory.  He also mentions rumors of a 128 version of the game, but these have been denied.

The review highlights the game's gameplay mechanics, including the need to collect items to reach the female character at the top left of the screen.  The reviewer criticizes the game's graphics, calling them ""solid and chunky"" and the pixelated character's knees ""pixely.""  He also notes the game's ability to slightly alter the screen layout, offering some variety.

The review concludes with a summary of the game's strengths and weaknesses.  The reviewer finds the game's most notable feature to be a poor rip-off of the Miami Vice soundtrack.  He rates the game's graphics, sound, toughness, staying power, and value with stars, indicating a mixed opinion.  The rating is 3 stars for graphics and sound, 3 stars for toughness, and 1 star for value.

**Overall:**

The review is a critical assessment of the game ""Bongo,"" highlighting both its positive and negative aspects.  The reviewer's tone is somewhat cynical, but the review provides a detailed account of the game's features and gameplay.  The inclusion of the game's screen display and the reviewer's rating system make the review informative and engaging for readers interested in the game.

54,"This page is a review of Ariolasoft's Movie Maker software for the Commodore computer.  The review is presented in a magazine article format, likely from a publication aimed at Commodore users.

**Review Title:** Ariolasoft's Movie Maker reviewed

**Review Rating:**  While the review doesn't explicitly assign a numerical rating, the overall tone suggests a mixed opinion.  The reviewer highlights both positive and negative aspects of the software.

**Review Body:**

The review begins by noting the recent popularity of ""aesthetic value"" software and how Ariolasoft's Movie Maker stands out as a unique approach.  It describes the software as having a ""construction"" theme, and the reviewer finds the concept of creating animation sequences intriguing.  The reviewer points out that the software's core function is similar to game design, involving sprites, images, backgrounds, and sound manipulation.  However, the similarities end there.

The review details the software's structure.  The package contains two disks: one for the main program and another for data (shapes, backgrounds, sound effects, and tunes).  The main program offers a menu-driven interface with options for Compose, Record, Smooth, and Play.  Each section is loaded individually from the data disk, which theoretically allows for a large amount of detail.

The review highlights the ""Compose"" section as the core animation design area.  The reviewer notes that the simplest way to create backgrounds is by using a graphics designer, but this process is slow and lacks the subtleties of modern design tools.  The reviewer emphasizes the animator function as the core strength of the software, allowing users to design shapes, copy them, and alter them slightly to create smooth animation sequences.

The review also discusses the ability to adjust animation parameters like replay rates, movement, and the position of the animation window on the screen.  This allows for experimentation with animation sequences before they are finalized.  The review concludes by mentioning the ability to save and reuse created sequences.

**Visual Elements:**

The page includes several black and white illustrations.  These illustrations depict examples of the animation sequences that can be created using the software.  The images show simple, pixelated graphics, typical of the era's computer graphics capabilities.  There are also screenshots of the software's interface and menu options.

**Target Audience:**

The review is clearly aimed at Commodore computer users interested in software for creating animation sequences.  The language and examples used are geared towards this specific audience.

**Overall Impression:**

The review presents a balanced perspective on Ariolasoft's Movie Maker.  While acknowledging some limitations (like the slow background creation process), the reviewer highlights the software's unique features and potential for creating animation sequences.  The review's tone suggests that the software might be a good choice for users willing to put in the effort to create their own animations.
