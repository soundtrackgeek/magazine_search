131,"This page is a review of the Medusa ST Emulator, a program designed to run Atari ST software on an Amiga computer.  The review, which appears in a publication called ""AMIGA FORMAT,"" is detailed and covers various aspects of the emulator's functionality and limitations.

**Review Rating (Implicit):** While not explicitly stating a numerical rating, the review presents a mixed assessment.  The review highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of the emulator.  The conclusion section acknowledges the emulator's success in providing a workable ST environment on the Amiga, but also points out that it's not suitable for all ST games.

**Sections and Details:**

* **Smooth Operator:** This section focuses on the emulator's performance once running.  The reviewer praises the emulator's ability to mimic the ST experience, noting that it even displays error messages similar to the ST's.  However, it also points out that the emulator only emulates a basic ST, ignoring the additional features of the STE (enhanced ST).  The review criticizes the emulator's inability to handle the ST's memory management limitations, which restricts the amount of usable memory.

* **Success and Failure:** This section delves into the emulator's compatibility with various ST software.  The review states that well-behaved ST software (like word processors and some applications) runs well, but games are a different story.  The review notes that many games fail to run, often due to the ST's unique protection mechanisms.  The success rate is estimated at around 80% for applications.

* **Conclusions:** This section summarizes the review's overall assessment.  The reviewer concludes that the emulator achieves its goal of providing a workable ST environment for some applications, but it's not a solution for running all ST games.  The review emphasizes that users shouldn't expect to run all ST games with the emulator.

* **Medusa ST Emulator Specifications:** This section provides details about the emulator's price, vendor information, and contact details.

* **Fast Facts:** This section provides key technical information about the emulator, including its memory requirements, compatibility with different ST features, and performance characteristics.  It highlights the emulator's ability to run ST software up to 22 times faster than a real ST, if using a fast 030 card.

* **Review of a competing emulator (Chameleon):**  The review mentions a competing emulator, ""Chameleon,"" which is described as software-only and costing £30.  This suggests a comparison between the two emulators in terms of price and functionality.

**Overall Impression:** The review provides a comprehensive overview of the Medusa ST Emulator, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.  It's clear that the emulator is capable of running a significant portion of ST software, but it's not a universal solution for all ST games.  The review also provides context by mentioning a competing emulator, Chameleon, which offers a different price point and approach.

167,"This page is a review of a music sequencer software called ""Trax,"" likely for the Amiga computer.  The review, written by Jon Bates, discusses the software's features, strengths, and weaknesses.

**Overall Impression:** The review seems to be mixed. While acknowledging some positive aspects, the author also points out quirks and limitations.

**Product Description:** The software is described as an entry-level sequencer from the Californian music software house Passport Designs.  It's positioned as a competitor to other sequencers like Dr. T, Gajits, and Digigram.

**Positive Aspects:**

* **Ease of Use (for A500 users):** The review highlights a key advantage: Trax runs on the Amiga 500 without needing extra memory or Workbench, making it accessible to users with less powerful machines.
* **Flexible Window Layout:** The program's architecture is praised for its flexible window arrangement, allowing users to position and resize windows easily using function keys.
* **Track List:** The 64-track capability is considered generous, with features to indicate record, play, mute, solo status, and track naming.
* **Program Selection and Looping:** The software allows for MIDI channel selection, program selection, and looping, which are important features for music production.
* **Preferences:** The ability to save and recall screen setups, MIDI settings, and quantize defaults is a useful feature.

**Negative Aspects (Quirks and Limitations):**

* **MIDI Channel Box:** The review criticizes the MIDI channel box, noting that users can enter numbers above 16 (the maximum), which the program doesn't handle well.  The author suggests a better way to handle this.
* **Command Mixture:** The review points out that some commands are activated by a combination of mouse clicks and keyboard input, which can be confusing.
* **Narrow Gauge:** The review notes that the screen display for tracks is limited to 15 tracks at a time, requiring scrolling to view all 64 tracks.  Looping functionality is also described as limited.
* **Editing Individual Notes:** The review mentions a shaded area for editing individual notes, but doesn't elaborate on the specific functionality.
* **Lack of Sound Preview:** The review criticizes the lack of an ""audition"" feature for sounds, requiring users to return to the selection box to hear each sound.

**Review Rating (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated, the review's tone suggests a mixed opinion.  The author highlights both positive and negative aspects, indicating a product with both strengths and weaknesses.

**Other Sections:**

* **Screenshots/Interface:** The page includes several screenshots of the Trax software's interface, showing the Track Sheet, various windows, and the editing environment.  These visuals help illustrate the features discussed in the review.

**MIDI Toolkit Review:**

The page begins with an advertisement for a ""MIDI Toolkit"" utility.  The review describes the toolkit as a useful tool for checking if MIDI gear is making proper contact.  It highlights the toolkit's four modes:

1.  **Analysis Mode:** This mode analyzes incoming MIDI data and displays it on screen as messages.  It identifies the channel and type of MIDI message.
2.  **Data Rate Mode:** This mode analyzes the amount of MIDI data sent over a four-minute period, measured in bytes per second.  This is important for troubleshooting issues with data overload or ""log-jams"" that can occur in sequencing software.
3.  **Real-time Monitoring Mode:** This mode allows the user to freeze the MIDI data stream at any time, providing a snapshot of the current state.
4.  **Troubleshooting Mode:** This mode is not explicitly named but is implied by the description of the test routine.  It checks for issues with MIDI cables and connections by testing the resistance and pin connections.

The review emphasizes the toolkit's usefulness for troubleshooting MIDI problems, particularly with older MIDI cables and connections.  It also mentions that the toolkit is a relatively inexpensive solution compared to more expensive hardware-based MIDI testers.

**Piglet Amplifier Review:**

A separate section reviews a ""Piglet Amplifier.""  The review describes the amplifier as a small, black box amplifier with a volume control and two sets of input/output leads.  It's designed for use with Amiga computers.
