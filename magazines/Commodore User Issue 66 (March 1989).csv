* **Sound:** 71%
* **Graphics:** 68%
* **Lastability:** 71%

The reviewer, Mark Patterson, describes the game as having a ""mysterious place"" called the ""Night House"" with treasure chests and other strange things.  The game features a dynamic duo of Batman and Robin (or a dwarf and a bird in the game), and the gameplay involves navigating levels, collecting keys, and eventually reaching a calculation room.  The reviewer notes that the game is split-screen, and the bird can ride on the dwarf.  The game is played in ten levels, each containing a piece of a key.

The reviewer points out that the game lacks a clear objective for the calculation room, and that the two-player mode relies more on strategy than fast-paced action.  While the graphics are described as ""quite nice"" and the backdrops are varied, the sound is considered ""average.""  The reviewer concludes that the game is not as dynamic as the title suggests.

* **Sound:** 30%
* **Graphics:** 50%
* **Lastability:** 35%
* **Playability:** 30%

The review begins by noting that the game, despite its title, is a basketball simulation.  It contrasts the game with its predecessor, highlighting the improvement in the number of options available.  The reviewer praises the impressive graphics, particularly the animation, but notes that the graphics are somewhat blocky.

The review criticizes the game's control system, describing it as awkward and slow, limiting player control and making the game less engaging.  The sound is also deemed poor, with only the ball sound effect being notable.  The reviewer points out that the game's progression is slow, and the action is not very zippy.

The review also discusses the game's one-on-one gameplay, noting that unless the player is coaching one of the players, the game relies heavily on luck.  The reviewer suggests that the lack of skill involved in the gameplay, combined with the awkward control system, will likely make the game lose interest quickly.

**Game Details:**

The review describes ""Laser Squad"" as a war game, but on a smaller scale.  The game involves a scenario called ""The Assassins,"" where Player one controls the Assassins and Player two (or the computer) controls Sterner Regnix, the head of an illegal drug ring.  The game involves arming characters with weapons and armor, deploying them, and navigating a map.  The game uses menus and a cursor to control actions.  The reviewer emphasizes the large, detailed map and the animation of most objects, though the main characters are not animated.  The reviewer also mentions the game's graphics and sound quality.

**Platform Specifics:**

The review mentions both a Commodore 64 version and an Amiga version.  The Amiga version is highlighted as having a significantly larger map (15 times the size of the 64 version), improved graphics, and enhanced sound.  The Amiga version is slated for release in late April.

**Expansion Pack:**

46,"The image is a poster, likely for a book, album, or other media.  It's a stylized, painterly artwork, not a photograph.

The poster's central image depicts a fantastical landscape.  A large, floating island, colored in shades of yellow-green and muted blues, is the focal point.  The island appears to be a hilltop or plateau with a small, light-colored fortress-like structure situated on it.  There are figures, possibly soldiers or figures in battle, scattered across the island's terrain.  The figures are small and stylized, and the overall impression is one of a scene from a fantasy or historical fiction work.

The background is a deep blue, with lighter, almost ghostly figures or shapes that seem to be swirling or floating in the air around the island.  These figures are painted in shades of light gray and white, giving a sense of atmosphere and depth.

The title or name of the work, ""CU,"" is prominently displayed in large, stylized, light gray letters.  The letters are bold and stand out against the dark background.  Above the letters, the words ""POSTER No12"" are printed in a smaller, sans-serif font.

The style of the artwork suggests a vintage or retro aesthetic, possibly from the mid-20th century.  The use of bold colors, stylized figures, and a painterly approach to the landscape all contribute to this impression.  The overall effect is one of a dramatic and evocative image, suitable for a poster promoting a work of fiction or fantasy.

There are no reviews or ratings visible on the image.  The image is purely a visual representation, not a review page.
"
47,"The image is a painting or a graphic design, likely for a book cover or game box.  It's not a typical webpage.

The overall impression is of a landscape, possibly a scene of destruction or conflict.  The colors are muted, with a strong presence of dark blues, deep greens, and fiery oranges/yellows.  The style suggests a dramatic, almost apocalyptic, atmosphere.

There are areas that appear to depict fire or smoke, with streaks and bursts of orange and yellow against a dark background.  Darker, almost charcoal-like, areas suggest dense vegetation or terrain.  The image has a textured quality, with visible brushstrokes or digital painting techniques.

The word ""POPULOUS"" is prominently displayed in a large, capitalized, light gray/beige font, set against a dark stone-like or slate-colored background.  This suggests the title or a key concept of the work.  There's a small, stylized, dark-colored creature or dragon-like figure positioned on the stone slab.  A small, stylized logo or mark (possibly a copyright symbol or initials) is also visible in the upper right quadrant.
