The gameplay involves picking up keys, blood bottles, garlic bombs, and other items to progress through the levels.

Instead of a true tubular environment, the game features a series of segments, each with three different ""zapping screens"" (levels).

* **Specific Gameplay Challenges:** The review highlights a particular challenge, the ""Oriental lakeside"" scene, where the player must catch a fly.  It also describes the ""ice-breaking"" bonus screen, where the player must waggle the joystick to break ice.

* **Myagi's Challenge:**  The review describes a unique and somewhat unusual gameplay element involving Myagi and chopsticks, where the player must catch a fly.  The reviewer notes that this screen is visually distinct from the others.

* **Overall Impression:** The reviewer concludes by stating that, despite a minor criticism about the game's ending, ""Karate Kid"" is an excellent game, particularly for its conversion from the Atari ST.  They praise the added graphics and action screens.

**Overall:** The review is positive, highlighting the game's smooth movement, detailed graphics, and engaging gameplay.  However, it also points out some minor issues, such as the constant music and the somewhat unsatisfying ending.  The reviewer's overall impression is that the game is a good addition to the Amiga gaming library.

68,"This page is an advertisement for a video game called ""The Armageddon Man,"" published by Martech.

The advertisement features a dramatic image of a man, seemingly in a position of power, holding the Earth in his hands.  The background depicts a scene of conflict and destruction, with missiles launching and explosions in the sky.  The overall tone is serious and suggests a high-stakes, global conflict scenario.

The text describes the game's premise: the year is 2032, and the world is on the brink of nuclear war.  Sixteen superpowers have formed an alliance, but trust is low.  The player takes on the role of the ""Armageddon Man,"" a supreme commander controlling a global network of satellites.  The player's choices will determine the fate of the world.

The advertisement also details the game's features, including a comprehensive instruction booklet, a large vinyl map of the world, and reusable flags to track events.  It lists the different versions of the game available (Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64/128) and their respective prices.  Finally, it provides contact information for ordering the game.

69,"This page is a review of the video game ""Space Quest"" for the Amiga computer system.  The review, written by Francis Jago, gives a very negative assessment of the game.

**Review Details:**

* **Game:** Space Quest
* **Platform:** Amiga
* **Price:** £19.95
* **Reviewer:** Francis Jago
* **Overall Rating:** 2 out of 10 (very poor)

**Review Content Breakdown:**

The review is structured into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the game:

* **Screen Scene:** The reviewer criticizes the graphics, describing them as reminiscent of early 8-bit games (like the VIC-20) with poor resolution and a lack of imagination.  The cockpit view is also criticized as a ""cock-up.""  The reviewer notes the characters are poorly designed, and the animation is jerky and slow.

* **Graphics:** The reviewer states the graphics are ""absolute rubbish"" and that the 3D graphics are not what they claim to be.

* **Sound:** The sound effects are described as poor, with only basic squeaks and bangs, and a poor opening tune.  This is contrasted with the better sound quality of other games like Starglider.

* **Toughness, Endurance, and Value:** These sections are part of a rating system, with the reviewer giving the game very low scores across all categories.

* **Gameplay:** The reviewer criticizes the gameplay, noting the slow loading times due to disk access, the poor control scheme, and the slow movement of the player character.  The game is described as repetitive and boring, with the reviewer stating that it's easy to get bored and fall asleep while playing.

* **Plot and Story:** The reviewer finds the plot and story to be unconvincing and poorly written, with the characters and their motivations not being well-developed.

* **Overall:** The reviewer concludes that the game is a poor port of a Commodore 64 game, with little to no improvements for the Amiga.  The overall experience is described as dull and frustrating.

**Additional Notes:**

The review includes screenshots of the game's graphics, showing the pixelated nature of the visuals.  The review also mentions the game's packaging and the claims made about the game's features, which the reviewer finds misleading.  The reviewer's overall impression is that the game is a significant disappointment, especially given the high expectations that the packaging might create.
