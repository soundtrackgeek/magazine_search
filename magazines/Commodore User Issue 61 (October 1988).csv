**Key Information:**

* **Game Title:** 1943: The Battle of Midway
* **Publisher:** Capcom/US
* **Format:** Gold Cartridge
* **Price:** £9.99/cassette, £14.99/disk
* **Review Rating:** 7 out of 10 (as indicated by the ""CU RATING"" section)

**Review Content Breakdown:**

The review is structured as a detailed analysis of the game, highlighting both similarities and differences with its predecessor:

* **Similarities:** The review notes the game retains the familiar format of its predecessor, including the downward scrolling seascape and the player controlling a twin-propeller seaplane.  The basic gameplay loop of taking off from a carrier and attacking enemy aircraft is also similar.

* **Differences:**  The review emphasizes the significant changes in gameplay.  Instead of a quick, intense blast, 1943 offers a more prolonged experience.  The player now has three lives, which are not lost as quickly as in 1942.  The game introduces a damage meter, and the player must now contend with two phases per level: destroying enemy planes and then attacking enemy ships.  A crucial difference is the introduction of POW symbols that change the player's weaponry.

* **Gameplay Mechanics:** The review explains the damage meter, the two-phase levels, the importance of POW symbols, and the different weaponry options.  It also mentions the two-player mode.

* **Comparison to 1942:** The review contrasts the two games, pointing out that while 1942 was a fast-paced experience, 1943 is more strategic and involves more phases.  The reviewer also notes that the ""squeezing more juice out of an old lemon"" analogy is apt.

* **Review Conclusion:** The reviewer concludes that while 1943 is a good game, it might not be as exciting as its predecessor in the early levels.  The reviewer suggests that players who enjoyed the loop-the-loop action of 1942 might find the new game a bit repetitive.  However, the reviewer also praises the game's tactical elements and the two-player mode.

**Additional Elements:**

* **Screen Shots:** The page includes black and white screen shots of the game, showing the game's graphical style and the on-screen elements like the damage meter and score.
* **Technical Specifications:**  The page includes a section with a digital points display and a rating system.
* **Video, Audio, Toughness, Endurance, VFM:**  These are likely categories used to assess the game's technical aspects.

The overall impression is of a detailed, well-structured review that provides a comprehensive overview of the game's features and compares it to its predecessor. The review rating of 7 suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly exceptional experience.

* **Gameplay:** The game involves a quest to destroy an evil Necron, with the player using a sword and bow.  The gameplay is described as ""clumsy"" due to the icon-based control system, which the reviewer feels is unnecessary and makes the game too easy.  The player navigates corridors, climbs, and fights enemies.  The game features a variety of enemies, including one-legged gremlins, ogres, and monsters.  The game also includes booby traps and resurrected enemies.
* **Graphics:** The reviewer notes that the detailed graphics that were initially appealing are now considered mediocre.

* **Overall:** The reviewer finds the game well-designed and presented, but the gameplay is simple and repetitive, relying on waggling the joystick.  The reviewer concludes that the game is not particularly fun unless the player is actually cycling.

**Game Overview:**

The review describes ""Star Goose"" as a ""shoot 'em up"" game where the player controls a craft called the Star Goose, navigating a vertically scrolling landscape of Nom.  The goal is to collect colored jewels and re-enter portals.  The game features a geodesic landscape, sloping hills, valleys, gun emplacements, static mines, and small fighter craft.

* **Publisher:** Codemasters
* **Platform:** 64-bit system (likely a home computer, given the context)
* **Price:** £4.99
* **Review Rating:** 5 out of 10 (CU Rating)

**Review Content:**

The review begins by highlighting the game's charitable aspect, noting that proceeds from the game go to Sport Aid.  The reviewer expresses some skepticism about the effectiveness of charity games, questioning whether the money raised is truly impactful.  They mention other charity games, like ""Off The Hook,"" ""Soft Aid,"" and ""WOW,"" but focus on the novelty of ""Race Against Time"" being specifically designed for charity.

The reviewer criticizes the game's lack of significant gameplay differences from the earlier Speccy version, calling the delay in release surprising given the minimal graphical or gameplay changes.  They describe the game as a ""fatuous pick-up-and-drop arcade adventure"" where the player's character moves around the world using a stool.  The reviewer points out the player's tasks, such as taking a haddock to Sydney or sticking a baguette up their nose in Paris, as examples of the game's nonsensical challenges.

The reviewer's main point is that while the game is intended to raise money for charity, it doesn't offer a substantial gameplay experience.  They argue that the money raised might be better spent on more direct solutions to the problems of the Third World, rather than relying on charity games.  The reviewer concludes that the game's value is primarily for entertainment, not for its charitable impact.

**Review Details:**

The review begins by describing the game's premise, setting, and general gameplay.  It notes that the game is set in the streets of New York and features a three-player team.  The reviewer criticizes the game's graphics, calling the sprite quality a ""large dampener on the effect.""  The reviewer also points out that the game's controls, while allowing the player to change the controlled player, are not effective enough to compensate for the poor scrolling and difficulty in controlling the ball.  The reviewer finds the passing system straightforward but the shooting system confusing, noting that the ball can be aimed at various parts of the goal, but the player's shots aren't always on target.  The review also mentions the inclusion of offsides, but notes that they don't function well in the three-player format.
