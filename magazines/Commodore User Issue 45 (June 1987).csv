**Review Rating:** The review gives the game an overall score of 8 out of 10.

**Game Description:** The review highlights ""Thrust"" as a good game that doesn't require cutting-edge technology.  The game involves piloting a triangular spaceship that needs to collect fuel pods, destroy nuclear reactors, and escape before the core of a planet explodes.  The key to success is mastering the ship's controls, as momentum and gravitational pull from planets affect the ship's movement.  The game is challenging because of the need to precisely control the ship's thrust to conserve fuel and complete missions.  Collecting fuel pods and destroying reactors adds difficulty.

**Gameplay Mechanics:** The review emphasizes the unique control system, which is ""thrust-oriented.""  The ship's movement is affected by the gravitational pull of planets, and precise control is needed to navigate and avoid obstacles.  The game's challenge comes from the limited fuel and time, requiring players to become skilled at maneuvering the ship.  The review also notes the frustration of running out of fuel when close to completing a mission.

**Graphics and Sound:** The review acknowledges the game's simple graphics, but praises the game's addictive nature.  The sound effects are described as competent, with good retro rocket sounds and the noise of the ship's thrusters.

**Overall Impression:** The reviewer concludes that ""Thrust"" is a worthwhile purchase, offering many hours of gameplay.  The review recommends the game, particularly for those who enjoy a good challenge and retro-style gaming.  The reviewer also mentions a slight issue with flickering on harder levels.

**Additional Information:** The page includes screenshots of the game's interface, showing the spaceship, fuel levels, lives, and score.

The response provides the POKE commands necessary to disable and restore these keys in both 64 and 128 modes.  The article highlights the differences in the POKE values required for the 128, emphasizing that the addresses are the same but the values are different.

**Random Number Generation:**

A reader seeks advice on generating random numbers in machine code.  The article recommends using the built-in ROM routines ($EO8B and $EO9E) for generating repeatable or non-predictable sequences.  It also explains how to use a fixed seed value and how to convert the floating-point result to an integer.  The author also suggests resources for learning more about 6502 assembly language programming.

**Sprite Animation:**

A reader's query about sprite animation on the Commodore 64 is addressed.
