**Review Summary:**

The review begins by discussing the game's team-based gameplay, contrasting it with the more popular deathmatch mode.  It highlights the addition of new character classes with unique abilities (Guard, Scout, Doubler) and special items like the Invulnerability Sphere and Kamikaze.  The review also notes the return of familiar weapons like the Doom chaingun and prox grenades.  While the core gameplay mechanics are similar to Quake III, the addition of new modes (Harvester and Overload) and maps adds complexity.

It also notes the user interface, which is described as easy to use, mimicking the style of Unreal Tournament.  However, the review criticizes the new player models and voice acting as subpar.

* **Graphics and Sound:** The review criticizes the player models and voice acting as lacking in quality compared to other games.

**Value Proposition:** The review questions the value of the expansion, particularly for players who aren't already deeply invested in EverQuest.

82,"This page is a review of the video game ""IHRA Motorsports,"" published by Bethesda Softworks.  The review, written by Andy Mahood, is from *PC Gamer* magazine, March 2001, and is located on page 76.

The review gives the game a 51% rating, categorized as ""Merely Okay.""

**Review Details:**

The reviewer begins by noting the game's setting within a trilogy of drag-racing simulations.  The game is fully sanctioned by the International Hot Rod Association (IHRA), allowing players to race over 50 dragsters in six classes on various IHRA-approved tracks.  However, the reviewer criticizes the game's significant flaws.

**Criticisms:**

* **Numerous Bugs and Glitches:** The game is riddled with bugs and non-functional features, hindering the overall experience.  The reviewer points out that many features, like gauges and AI opponents, don't work as intended.  The ""Christmas tree"" lights for handicaping slower cars don't function correctly, and AI cars frequently disqualify themselves by running under their pre-race times.  The game's traction physics are also unrealistic.
* **Poor AI:** The game's AI opponents are described as ""brain-dead,"" making the racing experience less challenging and engaging.
* **Incomplete Features:** The game lacks a functional paint shop, a key customization feature for drag racers.
* **Mediocre Graphics:** The exhaust flames and FMV video sequences are considered mediocre by current racing simulation standards.
* **Premature Release:** The review criticizes the rushed release of the game, noting that a patch was released after the game's initial release to address many of the issues.  The review explicitly states that it reflects the shrink-wrapped version of the game, not the patched version.

**Positive Aspects:**

* **Extensive Vehicle Customization:** The game offers a large selection of vehicles (over 50) and extensive customization options, allowing players to create powerful nitro-burning dragsters.
* **Engaging Gameplay (Potentially):** The reviewer acknowledges the potential for a fun and engaging experience with the customization options, but the bugs and glitches prevent this from being realized.
* **Pleasing Graphics (in some aspects):** The reviewer notes that the 3D track and vehicle graphics can be visually appealing, especially at higher resolutions.

**Final Verdict:**

The review concludes that while the game has a large collection of vehicles and a garage menu, the significant bugs, poor AI, and unrealistic physics make it a disappointing experience.  The reviewer highlights that the patched version of the game is a significant improvement, but the initial release is a waste of hard drive space for most gamers.  The review emphasizes that the game's release was rushed and that the experience is not worth the time and patience required to fix the issues.

83,"This page is a review of the Sega Rally 2 video game for PC, published in PC Gamer magazine in March 2001.

The review gives the game a 32% rating, categorized as ""Don't Bother.""

**Review Details:**

The review begins by highlighting the game's arcade-to-PC porting, noting it's a long tradition but this particular port is considered the most egregious example.  The reviewer criticizes the game's outdated 3D graphics engine, which is described as archaic and reminiscent of pre-Win 98 era technology.  The force feedback is also deemed substandard.  The ""championship"" mode is criticized for forcing players to start from the beginning of a multi-event series if they fail a checkpoint.  The game's gameplay is described as shallow and the ""Game Over, Yeeaah!"" jingle is called out as annoying.

The review praises the variety of gameplay modes (Arcade, Time Attack, Championship, and two-player split-screen events, plus LAN/Internet play).  However, the limited track variety (only 35 miles of off-road real estate) and the floaty driving model are significant criticisms.  The reviewer notes the cars appear to float over the road surfaces and there's no damage modeling.  The reviewer suggests the most effective way to set record times is to keep the throttle buried and bank-shot through the courses.

The graphics are criticized, with the impressive 3D car models contrasted with dubious 2D spectator bitmaps and laughable dust/spray effects.  The maximum screen resolution of 800x600 is described as reinforcing a retro feel.

The review concludes with a ""Final Verdict"" section, summarizing the pros and cons.  The positive aspects are a short learning curve and a healthy selection of gameplay modes, along with 19 licensed rally vehicles.  The negative aspects are the floaty driving model, limited track variety, archaic graphics, poor force feedback, and the lack of damage modeling.  The overall conclusion is that the game is more like bumper-bowling than driving, and the arcade port is underwhelming.

The review is signed by Andy Mahood.  The page also includes screenshots and information about the game's technical requirements.

88,"This page is a review of the video game ""Freedom: First Resistance"" from PC Gamer magazine, dated March 2001.

The review is a negative one, giving the game a 40% rating, labeled as ""Tolerable.""

**Review Details:**

The reviewer, Stephen Poole, criticizes several aspects of the game:

* **Poor Save System:** The most significant complaint is the save-game system.  It allows only one save per ""campaign"" (a series of missions), meaning players can't easily load previous levels or items.  Furthermore, a bug exists where hitting the spacebar or clicking a mouse button during the ""Mission Complete"" message results in losing all collected items. This forces the player to replay the first three missions.

* **Uninspired Story and Gameplay:** The plot, based on sci-fi novels, doesn't translate well into the game. The reviewer finds the environments unimpressive and the alien-infested settings unengaging.  The ""adventure"" sequences are described as a tedious scavenger hunt with numerous keys, corridors, and door puzzles.

* **Tedious Dialogue and Combat:** The dialogue is described as ""unskippable"" and ""dreary,"" and the combat is deemed ""utterly dull.""  The reviewer also notes the lack of ambient sound effects and the inability to bypass dialogue sequences.

* **Technical Issues:** The game has a pre-mission loadout sequence that is described as tedious.  The reviewer also points out the inability to access options during missions.

* **Missing Features:** The reviewer notes the almost total lack of ambient sound effects and the inability to bypass dialogue sequences.

**Positive Aspects (though limited):**

The reviewer does acknowledge the game's interesting premise, though they feel it wasn't fully realized.

**Overall:**

The review concludes that while the premise is interesting, the game's poor save system, tedious gameplay, and technical issues outweigh any positive aspects, resulting in a very low score and a recommendation to avoid the game.

**Technical Information (from the top of the page):**

The review also includes technical specifications for the game, including the required and recommended hardware (PII 300/450, RAM, HD space, 3D card), developer (Red Storm), publisher (Red Storm), and maximum players (1).  The game's category is listed as Action/Adventure.

**Review Details:**

It praises the game's ability to replicate the atmosphere of a pool hall.  The reviewer notes that the game has improved significantly over previous iterations in the series.

The review then discusses the game's career mode, noting that while the concept is good, the implementation could be better.

The review also discusses the game's gameplay options, including 21 different game variations (like eight-ball and snooker) and various tables (amateur, professional, and championship).

The reviewer also mentions the game's tracking lines, which show the results of a shot before it's made.

**Overall:**

The reviewer praises the impeccable physics and the large number of gameplay options, but criticizes the lack of personality in the AI opponents and the need for a more user-friendly interface.  The review ultimately recommends the game, stating that the game's realistic physics and gameplay options make it a worthwhile purchase for pool enthusiasts.

* **Rating:**  The review concludes with a ""Final Verdict"" that is largely negative, despite the speakers having some positive aspects.
* **Summary:** The reviewer praises the speaker system's features, including a wireless remote, subwoofer, and five satellite speakers. However, the review criticizes the sound quality, particularly in digital mode.  The bass response and overall volume levels are deemed underwhelming compared to other, more expensive options.  The highs are also described as brittle.  The reviewer notes that the speakers are adequate for AC3 surround sound, but not for general PC use.  The final verdict suggests that the speakers are a decent value for the price, but not a top-tier choice.

**Review 2: Logitech SoundMan Xtruiso DSR-100 Speakers**

* **Rating:** The review concludes with a ""Final Verdict"" that is positive, though the reviewer notes a missed opportunity for a higher rating.
* **Summary:** The review highlights the speakers' surprisingly good sound quality despite their small size and light weight.  The reviewer notes that the satellites are capable of producing decent sound, even at higher volumes.  The subwoofer is also praised for its performance.  The included remote control and headphone jack are also mentioned as convenient features.  The reviewer acknowledges that the speakers aren't groundbreaking, but they provide good value for the price.  The final verdict suggests that the speakers are a solid choice for PC use.

* **Price:** $49.99
* **Review Summary:** The review praises the surprisingly good sound quality for the low price.  While the satellite speakers are slightly bright, the overall sound, especially the subwoofer, is impressive and considered amazing for the price.  The inclusion of a headphone jack is a positive feature.  The only significant drawback is that the satellite speakers are hardwired together, limiting their placement flexibility.  The reviewer concludes that for $50, the speakers are a great value, though they wouldn't replace more expensive models.

**Review 2: Creative Labs VoIP Blaster**

* **Product:** Creative Labs VoIP Blaster
* **Price:** $19.99

It has inputs for headsets and regular phones.  The review mentions the ability to send voice messages up to three minutes long.  Positive aspects include the clear sound and ease of connection.  Drawbacks include slight delays (one to one and a half seconds), the need for a network connection, and the fact that charges apply when calling non-VoIP users.  The reviewer concludes that it's the best Internet phone solution they've seen, but it's not suitable for all users.

110,"This page is an article from PC Gamer magazine, specifically from the March 2001 issue, titled ""Agents of Change.""  The article is an opinion piece, advocating for a Hollywood-style talent agency for game developers.

The article begins with a headline and a sub-headline that introduce the concept of a game development agency.  The author, Dan Morris, is identified.

The article then presents an argument for the need for such an agency.  It states that the current system of game development is inefficient, relying on developers to find their own opportunities.  The author argues that a centralized agency would act as a filter, identifying talented individuals and teams, and connecting them with publishers.  The agency would act as a ""door-opener"" for these developers, providing them with access to opportunities they might otherwise miss.

The article highlights the success of amateur development teams, particularly in the modding community, and argues that this talent is often overlooked.  It uses the example of ""FireArms for Half-Life"" as a successful mod, and suggests that a dedicated agency could help identify and nurture similar talent.

The article also discusses the benefits for publishers.  It argues that a centralized agency would streamline the process of finding and vetting talent, saving time and resources.  The agency would act as a pre-screening system, filtering out less qualified applicants.

The article concludes by emphasizing the potential for a symbiotic relationship between game companies and the agency, with the agency providing access to talented developers and the companies providing the opportunities.  The author believes that a reasonable markup for the agency's services would be justified by the value it brings to both parties.

A small image of a Counter-Strike scene is included, likely to illustrate the type of mod that the agency would be interested in.

A ""Game of the Year"" section is also present, highlighting ""Firearms for Half-Life"" as the top game of the year.  The section also lists ""Deus Ex"" and ""The Sims"" as runner-ups.

The overall review rating is not explicitly stated as a numerical score, but the tone of the article is positive and enthusiastic about the proposed agency.

113,"This page is from PC Gamer magazine, March 2001, and contains a review of the video game ""Sin: The Movie.""  The review, written by Colin Williamson, is a negative one, giving a critical assessment of the film adaptation of the first-person shooter game.

**Review of ""Sin: The Movie""**

The review is titled ""Breasts and Mutants"" and begins by noting the oddity of a first-person shooter being adapted into a full-length animated movie.  The reviewer, a self-proclaimed connoisseur of game-related cinematic disasters,  explains that they watched the movie with some anticipation.

The review details the plot's loose connection to the game, focusing on the character of John Blade and his quest to confront the biogeneticist Elexis Sinclaire.  The reviewer highlights the poor quality of the film, citing issues like:

* **Uninspired plot:** The plot is described as incomprehensible, both in English and Japanese.
* **Poor animation and special effects:** The reviewer criticizes the use of CGI, the overuse of lens flares, and the overall quality of the visual effects.
* **Excessive violence and gore:** The review notes the abundance of blood and graphic violence, comparing it to ""Saving Private Ryan"" in terms of its intensity.
* **Unnecessary elements:** The reviewer points out a shower scene and the character's kinky French maid outfit as unnecessary additions.
* **Weak characterization:** The reviewer finds the character of JC, the hacker buddy, to be the only halfway interesting character in the game, but the movie portrayal is poor.
* **Poorly executed action sequences:** The reviewer notes that the action sequences are not well-executed, with some scenes being out of place.

The review also mentions the film's anime-style visuals and the use of Japanese animation techniques.  The reviewer notes that the film is outsourced to a Japanese animation house, which is a factor in the film's style.

**Overall Assessment**

The reviewer concludes that the movie is ""infinitely more microwaveable than watchable,"" and expresses disappointment in the film's quality.  They criticize Hollywood's attempts at adapting video games into movies, suggesting that games are meant to be played, not watched.  The review ends with a plea for better treatment of game adaptations in the future.

**Other Sections**

The page also includes a section titled ""Game of the Year,"" which highlights ""Counter-Strike"" as the best first-person shooter of the year.  This section is a separate piece from the review of ""Sin: The Movie.""

114,"The page is an advertisement for JoWood Productions video games, likely from a magazine or catalog.

The advertisement prominently displays the headline ""Over 1,000,000 Copies Sold in Europe,"" emphasizing the games' popularity.

115,"This page is from PC Gamer magazine, March 2001, and features an article titled ""Don't Cross the Streams!"" by Michael Wolf.  The article is an opinion piece discussing the merging of console and PC RPGs.

**Review Rating:**  There isn't a single review rating in the traditional sense.  The article expresses an opinion, but it's not a review of a specific game in the way a typical game review would be.

**Article Content:**

The article opens with a strong opinion piece from Michael Wolf, who argues that the convergence of PC and console RPGs is a trend that could negatively impact PC gamers.  He points out that while console RPGs are becoming more sophisticated, the methods that make them successful on consoles don't always translate well to the PC.

Wolf uses the example of Final Fantasy VII's PC port as a case study.  He criticizes the port for its inferior visuals and performance compared to the console version, highlighting the challenges of adapting console-centric design to the PC.

He further argues that the desire of publishers to create games easily portable across multiple platforms (PC, PS2, Dreamcast, etc.) might lead to compromises in the PC version.  He questions whether games designed with console controls and interfaces in mind will be optimized for the PC experience.

The article also touches on the ""Game of the Year"" section, highlighting Deus Ex as a standout game of 2000.  This section is separate from the main argument but provides context on the overall quality of games released that year.

The article concludes with Wolf's personal perspective on the matter. He acknowledges the appeal of console RPGs but worries that the trend toward cross-platform development might diminish the unique strengths of PC RPGs. He expresses concern that the PC's strengths, such as superior hardware and customization, might be overlooked in favor of a more generalized approach.

**Visual Elements:**

The page includes a picture of a monster from a game (likely Summoner), which is used to illustrate the article's points about the challenges of cross-platform development.  The image is a still from the game, showing a creature in a game environment.

**Overall:**

The article is a critical analysis of the emerging trend of cross-platform RPG development.  It argues that while console RPGs are improving, the resulting games might not fully capitalize on the PC's unique strengths.  The article is opinion-based and doesn't offer a definitive review of any specific game, but rather a perspective on the potential impact of this trend on the PC gaming community.
