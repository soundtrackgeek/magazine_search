"
39,"This page contains information about a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) called RANDOM.  It's likely part of a larger document, perhaps a technical manual or programming guide, given the detailed explanation and assembly code listings.

The text describes the algorithm and implementation of the PRNG, focusing on its properties and how it works.

**Section 1:  Pseudorandom Sequence Properties**

The first part explains the concept of pseudorandom sequences.  It notes that while a sequence might appear random for a short period, it's ultimately predictable because it's based on a deterministic algorithm.  The example shows a sequence of numbers (1, 2, 4, 9, 3, 6, etc.) generated by a four-bit value.  The text emphasizes that the apparent randomness increases with the length of the sequence.

**Section 2:  Hardware/Software Implementation**

The text describes how pseudorandom sequences are typically generated in hardware using shift registers and exclusive OR (XOR) gates.  It explains that this process can be easily simulated in software.  It highlights the RANDOM subroutine, which is a software implementation of this algorithm.  The subroutine is designed to generate 8-bit values.

**Section 3:  RANDOM Subroutine Details**

This section dives into the specifics of the RANDOM subroutine.  It explains that the subroutine starts by loading the accumulator with the value from the random byte, accessed via the index register.  The sequence is 255 values long.  The text emphasizes that if the byte is initialized to a fixed value, the sequence will be predictable.  Otherwise, the sequence depends on the prior memory content, making it unpredictable.

**Section 4:  Table 1: Properties of Pseudorandom Generators**

This table lists the period, feedback bits, and mask for different stages of the PRNG.  The period is the length of the sequence before it repeats.  The feedback bits are the bits used in the XOR operation.  The mask is the bit pattern used in the XOR operation.  The table shows the properties for PRNGs with 2 to 16 stages.

**Section 5:  RANDOM Logic Explanation**

This section provides a detailed explanation of the RANDOM logic.  It explains how the value zero is handled to avoid issues with the sequence.  It describes the feedback loop, which uses an exclusive OR (XOR) operation on certain bits.  It also explains how the AND instruction is used to select the bits for the XOR operation.  The text explains how the SHIFT loop works, moving bits from the accumulator to the carry flag.

**Section 6:  Listing 2: Using the RANDOM Routine**

This section presents assembly code (Listing 2) that demonstrates how to use the RANDOM subroutine to generate a 16-bit pseudorandom number.  The code shows how to call the RANDOM subroutine multiple times to generate the full 16-bit number.  The code also includes comments explaining the purpose of each instruction.

The listing details the assembly code for the ""DICE"" program.  It shows the hexadecimal machine code, corresponding assembly instructions (e.g., `LDAA`, `JSR`), labels (e.g., `DIE`, `ROLL`), and operands.  A commentary section explains the purpose of each instruction, such as initializing a pseudorandom number seed, moving values to registers, and conditional branching.  The code is designed to simulate rolling dice, generating a random number between 2 and 12.

**Commentary on the Code:**

The commentary explains the logic behind the program, including how it uses the `RANDOM` subroutine to generate pseudorandom numbers.  It describes the process of generating a random number, truncating it to the low four bits, and handling cases where the result is outside the desired range (2-12), requiring the process to be repeated.

**Longer Sequences:**

This section discusses how to generate longer pseudorandom number sequences using the `RANDOM` subroutine.  It explains that the 8-bit accumulator of the 6800 processor limits the `RANDOM` subroutine to 8 stages.  The text suggests that more complex programs can be written to generate longer sequences, and provides a table of masks for up to 16-bit generators.  It also describes an alternative method (`RAND2`) for generating longer sequences by using the `RANDOM` subroutine twice.

**Rolling the Die:**

This section provides a practical example of using the `DICE` program.  It explains how the program simulates rolling a pair of dice, generating a random number between 2 and 12.  It also discusses how the program can be modified to simulate other random events, such as rolling a single die or flipping a coin.

"
53,"This page contains assembly language instructions and explanations for converting various character string formats (binary, octal, hexadecimal, and signed decimal) to and from unsigned and signed integers.  It's likely part of a larger document or tutorial on computer programming, specifically focusing on ASCII character handling and binary conversions.

The text is divided into sections:

**1. Necessary Conversions:**  This section outlines the different types of character string conversions needed, ordered by increasing complexity.  It lists conversions between binary character strings (ASCII 0 or 1) and unsigned 8-bit integers, octal character strings and unsigned 8-bit integers, hexadecimal character strings and unsigned 16-bit integers, and signed decimal character strings and signed 16-bit integers.

**2. Algorithm and Examples:**  The text describes an algorithm for converting an ASCII character to its binary representation.  It provides examples of how to convert the ASCII characters '0', '1', and '9' into their corresponding binary values using a bitwise AND operation.  This section explains how the high-order bits of the ASCII character are masked off, leaving only the relevant binary representation of the character's value.

**3. Binary Conversions:** This section discusses the conversion of ASCII character codes (1 and 0) into binary values.  It emphasizes that converting 1 and 0 into binary is the simplest conversion to implement.

**4. Routine Description:** The text describes a routine (likely in assembly language) for converting a string of ASCII characters (e.g., '1011') into a binary number.  It explains that the routine processes each character individually, shifting the accumulated binary value to the left and ORing the new character's binary value with it.  This is equivalent to multiplying the accumulated value by 2 and adding the new character's value.  The example given is for a four-character string ('1011'), but the routine is designed to handle strings of any length up to eight characters.

**5. Assembly Language Code (Listing 1b):** This section presents a portion of assembly language code (likely for an 8080 processor).

"
54,"This page contains two flowcharts (Figures 1a and 1b) and a table of assembly language instructions (Listing 2a).  The flowcharts depict the logic of two routines, BIN and BOT, likely part of a larger program.

**Figure 1a: The BIN Routine Flowchart**

This routine processes ASCII '0' and '1' characters as input, treating them as binary digits.  It shifts these digits into a register called ANSWER (register B in the 8080 code).  The process continues until an invalid character is encountered or an overflow occurs, at which point control is returned.  The flowchart details the steps involved in shifting the binary digits and handling potential errors.

**Figure 1b: The BOT Routine Flowchart**

This routine is responsible for outputting an 8-digit ASCII binary string.  It takes the binary data from the ANSWER register and converts it into a string of ASCII characters.  The output is printed in high-order to low-order sequence.  The flowchart shows the steps involved in rotating the bits in the ANSWER register and outputting them one by one.

**Listing 2a: The OIN Routine**

This section provides assembly language instructions for a routine called OIN.  It's likely a subroutine that is called by the BIN and BOT routines.

The flowcharts and assembly code provide a detailed view of how the program processes data.  The notes highlight the need for specific address values to be filled in for the code to function correctly.
"
55,"This page contains detailed instructions and assembly code for an 8080 computer program.  It describes two routines: one for converting binary input strings into a character representation, and another for converting octal input strings into a character representation.

**Binary Input Routine:**

The first section details a routine for processing binary input strings.  It explains the need for delimiters (characters other than '0' or '1') to mark the beginning and end of the input.  The routine checks for characters outside the valid range ('0' to '1') to identify invalid input.  Crucially, it addresses the potential for input strings exceeding 8 bits (255 decimal), which could cause an overflow condition.  The routine uses a carry bit to handle potential overflow situations.  The text explains how the carry bit is affected during left-shift operations, and how the routine manages the overflow.

The page includes a flow diagram (Figure 1a) and assembly code (Listing 1a) for the binary input procedure.  The assembly code shows the specific instructions (e.g., `MVI`, `XRA`, `MOV`, `JMP`, `POP`, `RAL`, `PUSH`, `ANI`, `ORI`, `CALL`, `DCR`, `JNZ`, `POP`, `RET`) used in the routine.  Detailed comments explain the purpose of each instruction and the variables involved.  The comments also highlight the importance of the carry flag and the use of specific registers (like `A`, `B`, `C`, `PSW`).

**Octal Input Routine:**

The second section describes a similar routine for processing octal input strings.  It explains how the routine handles input strings containing octal digits ('0' to '7').  The routine's logic is modified to handle 3-bit shifts instead of 1-bit shifts, and the mask used for the logical AND operation is changed to `7` (octal).  The routine also addresses the 8-bit limitation of the output value, explaining how it processes the bits in groups of two and three to handle the octal representation.

The page includes a flow diagram (Figure 2a) and likely assembly code (Listing 2b) for the octal input procedure.  The description of the octal routine emphasizes the importance of handling the carry flag during the bit-shifting process.

**Overall:**

The page provides a comprehensive explanation of the routines, including the logic, flow diagrams, and assembly code.  It's clear that the author is explaining the process in detail, including error handling and potential issues like overflow.  The use of comments in the assembly code makes the code easier to understand and follow.  The page is likely part of a larger document or manual, providing technical details for programmers working with the 8080 processor.
"
56,"This page contains two flowcharts, labeled Figure 2a and Figure 2b, depicting the OIN (input) and OOT (output) routines for an 8080 computer system.  Both routines are designed to handle octal character input and output.

**Figure 2a: The OIN Routine**

This flowchart details the process of accepting octal input characters.  The input is initially checked to ensure it's a valid octal character (0-7).  If it's not, the routine terminates.  If valid, the character is shifted left three bits and stored in the ANSWER register.  The process continues until an invalid character or an overflow condition occurs.  The routine uses a register called ANSWER, which is likely a 8-bit register.  The flowchart shows how the input is processed bit by bit, and how the overflow condition is handled.  The process also involves a stack, which is used for temporary storage.

**Figure 2b: The OOT Routine**

This flowchart describes the output routine for converting octal characters to their ASCII representations.  The routine is more complex than the input routine because it needs to handle the conversion of 3-bit octal values to 8-bit ASCII characters.  A key aspect is the handling of the carry flag as a ninth bit, which is necessary because 8 bits isn't a multiple of 3.  The flowchart shows how the output is processed, including the shifting of bits, extraction of 3-bit chunks, and the creation of the corresponding ASCII characters.  The routine also uses a stack for temporary storage.

**Additional Notes:**

* **Hexadecimal Input/Output:** The text below the flowcharts explains that hexadecimal input and output use similar logic to the octal routines, but with different legal characters ('0' through '9' and 'A' through 'F').
* **Register Usage:** The text describes the use of the A register and carry flag in both routines.  The A register is used for storing and manipulating data, and the carry flag is used to indicate overflow conditions.
* **8080 Assembly Code:** The text mentions ""listing 2a"" and ""listing 2b,"" suggesting that these are likely assembly language listings for the OIN and OOT routines, respectively.  These listings would provide the detailed instructions for the 8080 processor to execute the routines.
* **Data Representation:** The routines are designed to handle ASCII characters, which are 8-bit representations of characters.  The octal input is converted to ASCII output.
* **Overflow Handling:** Both routines include checks for overflow conditions, which are important for preventing data corruption.

In summary, the page provides a detailed description of two crucial routines for handling octal character input and output in an 8080-based system.  The flowcharts and accompanying text explain the logic, register usage, and data representation involved in these routines.
"
57,"This page contains assembly language code, likely for an 8080 microprocessor.  It's a listing of instructions, with accompanying commentary explaining the purpose and function of each section of code.  There are three distinct sections (Note 1, Note 2, and Note 3) each with a set of instructions and associated comments.

**Note 1:** This section details a routine labeled ""XIN"".  It appears to be designed to input hexadecimal characters from an external source.  The code takes input characters, checks if they are within a specific range (e.g., '0' to '9', 'A' to 'F'), and converts them into a numerical representation.  The comments explain the logic behind the conditional jumps and arithmetic operations.  Crucially, the code references ""GET"" (likely another subroutine) and expects addresses to be replaced with placeholders (""xx xx"").

**Note 2:** This section describes a routine labeled ""XOT"".  This routine appears to perform the reverse operation of Note 1, converting a numerical value (likely a 16-bit number stored in CPU registers H and L) into a string of hexadecimal characters.  The code handles the conversion from binary to ASCII representation, including adding the appropriate ASCII offset for '0' to '9' and 'A' to 'F'.  Again, placeholder addresses (""xx xx"") are present, indicating where other subroutines or data are located.

**Listing 3a and 3b:** These listings provide additional context for the routines in Note 1 and Note 2.  Listing 3a describes the ""XIN"" routine in more detail, explaining how it handles input characters and converts them into a 16-bit number.  Listing 3b describes the ""XOT"" routine, explaining how it converts the 16-bit number into a 4-digit hexadecimal ASCII string.  Both listings highlight the use of CPU registers (e.g., ANSWER, H, L) and the interaction with external devices (e.g., PUT).

**General Observations:**

* **Assembly Language:** The code is written in assembly language, using mnemonics and instructions specific to the 8080 processor.
* **Subroutines:** The code utilizes subroutines (e.g., GET, PUT, XINLOOP, XOTLOOP, XOTASCII) to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts.
* **Comments:** Extensive comments are provided to explain the purpose and logic of each instruction and section of code.
* **Data Conversion:** The code performs conversions between hexadecimal characters, binary values, and ASCII representations.
* **Error Handling:** The code includes checks for valid input characters and handles potential errors (e.g., non-numeric input).
* **Placeholder Addresses:** The presence of ""xx xx"" placeholders indicates that the code is part of a larger program, and these addresses need to be filled in to make the code executable.

Overall, the page provides a detailed description of two assembly language routines designed for hexadecimal input and output conversion.  The extensive comments and explanations make the code relatively easy to understand, despite the use of assembly language.

The routine converts the low-order bits to a binary representation and shifts the value.  Crucially, it describes how this routine works within the context of an 8080 computer, where the `ANSWER` register becomes the HL index register pair, and the 8080's double-precision addition operation is used.  The flowchart details the steps involved in this conversion and error handling (invalid characters or overflow).

**Figure 3b: The XOT Routine Flowchart**

This flowchart describes a routine named ""XOT"" that converts a 16-bit hexadecimal quantity (stored in the `ANSWER` register) into a series of ASCII hexadecimal characters.  It starts with the high-order digit and shifts out 4 bits at a time.  The flowchart shows how the routine adjusts the value if alphabetic codes are encountered and then prints the ASCII representation of the hexadecimal value.  It also details the creation and printing of four digits before returning.  Similar to Figure 3a, this routine is also described in the context of an 8080 computer.

**Overall Description**

The page presents two flowcharts (Figure 3a and 3b) that detail the logic for converting between 16-bit hexadecimal input and output, likely for a computer system.  The text accompanying the flowcharts explains the routines' functionality, their implementation on an 8080 computer, and how they might be adapted to other systems, particularly those with 8-bit processors.

**Software Bug of the Month (Issue 4):**

The article details a bug found in a FORTRAN program designed to determine if a number is prime.  The program, intended to test if a number (N) is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of N, had a critical flaw in its logic.

* **The Problem:** The program's BNF (Backus-Naur Form) rule for recognizing unsigned integers was incorrectly ordered.  This caused an infinite loop, as the recognizer would recursively call itself instead of correctly parsing the entire integer.

* **The Solution:** The programmer initially tried to fix the bug by rearranging the BNF rule, but this only created another infinite loop. The correct solution involved a different rearrangement of the rule, ensuring the recognizer processed the entire integer correctly.

* **The Deeper Issue:** The programmer's mistake highlights the importance of thorough testing and careful consideration of potential edge cases.  The programmer, initially confident in the program's correctness after extensive testing, failed to anticipate the recursive nature of the BNF rule and the potential for infinite loops.

* **The Code Example:** The article provides a simplified FORTRAN subroutine (`SUBROUTINE PRIME(N, K)`) illustrating the program's logic.  This code snippet demonstrates how the program was supposed to work and where the error occurred.

**Additional Information:**

The article also includes a separate section advertising a microcomputer (the HAL MCEM-8080) from HAL Communications Corp.
