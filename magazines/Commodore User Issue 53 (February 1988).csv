The reviewer highlights the game's engaging storyline, hidden messages, and illusions, making it a ""best budget game.""  The reviewer also notes that the game's concept isn't entirely original, drawing comparisons to older games.

The review by Ferdy Hamilton is more critical of the game's core mechanics.  While acknowledging the game's realistic fruit machine features (scrolling reels, tunes, etc.), the reviewer finds the core gameplay repetitive and ultimately uninspired.  The reviewer's main complaint is that the game lacks the ""money coming out"" aspect that makes a real fruit machine engaging.  The reviewer gives the game a positive rating for its authenticity but ultimately suggests that the game's design is not particularly innovative.

**Game Description:**

The page describes the game as a fruit machine simulator, noting that it attempts to replicate the features of a traditional fruit machine, including ""Holds,"" ""Auto Win,"" ""Skill Climb,"" and ""Nudge Pot.""

The game's features are described in detail, including how to use the features and the potential rewards.

The review is presented in a column format, with a large, stylized title ""SIDEWALK"" dominating the top portion of the page.  The review includes a rating of 5 out of 10.

**Game Overview:**

The review describes ""Sidewalk"" as a comic-strip arcade adventure game, similar to ""Andy Capp,"" with a focus on action and navigating the streets.  The reviewer notes that 90% of the gameplay takes place in the streets, emphasizing the importance of being in the right place at the right time.  However, the graphics are described as a stark contrast, featuring grotesque characters (punks, heavies, hippies) with exaggerated features (phallic noses, leering grins, large breasts).  The reviewer also mentions the game's violent and sexist style, comparing it to underground comics like Fritz the Cat.

**Gameplay Details:**

The review highlights the gameplay mechanics, including the need to collect parts of a motorcycle, interact with characters, and solve puzzles.  The player character is described as having a digital watch and a purse with £50, which are used to navigate the game's environment.  The reviewer notes the limited playing area, with only a dozen or so locations, and the sometimes illogical route between them.  The reviewer also points out the disappointing combat sequences and the difficulty in finding a logical path through the game.

**Review Critique:**

The reviewer criticizes the game's simplicity, stating that it can be completed in a couple of evenings, which is not sufficient for a full-priced game.  A significant complaint is the game's boastful claim to donate 15p to Band Aid for each copy sold.  The reviewer finds this a ""warped sense of priority"" and suggests that players would be better off donating directly to the charity instead of buying the game.  The reviewer concludes by recommending that players forget ""Sidewalk"" and donate to Band Aid instead.

**Other Information:**

The page also includes a price breakdown for the game, listing the cost per cassette and per disk.  There are also small images of game screens, showing the pixelated graphics and the game's interface.  The page also includes a section with the title ""Screen Scene"" and other game-related information.  The page's layout includes various graphics and text boxes, including a ""CU Rating"" section.

While acknowledging the ""near-perfect graphics and animation,"" the reviewer finds the game's core gameplay, which involves exploring and collecting items, to be a tired formula.  The reviewer also notes the game's focus on Andy Capp's typical daily life, which, while realistic, lacks the comedic punch expected from the character.  The review highlights a lack of humor, despite the game's attempt to capture the character's personality through animation and graphics.  The reviewer also mentions a smart-ass one-liner from a character as the closest thing to humor.

**Game Information:**

The page also provides information about the game itself.  It describes the game's premise, featuring Andy Capp in a monochrome world of terraced streets, corner shops, and brick walls.  The game's price is listed as £9.95 for a cassette version and £14.95 for a disk version.  The review mentions that the game's gameplay involves navigating the streets, interacting with characters, and collecting items.

The game's plot involves Andy trying to find his missing dole cheque.

**Graphics and Gameplay:**

The review mentions the game's graphics are ""near-perfect,"" but the gameplay is described as ""tired"" and ""explore-and-collect.""  The reviewer notes the use of a monochrome style, which is consistent with the character's comic strip origins.  The reviewer also points out the limited range of actions and the simple line backgrounds, which are described as ideal for transferring to the computer screen.

**Character and Story:**

The page describes Andy Capp as a lovable layabout, a character known for his scrounging and skiving.  The game's story follows Andy's typical daily life, including his interactions with various characters and situations.  The reviewer notes that the game's plot involves Andy trying to find his missing dole cheque.

**Technical Aspects:**

The page mentions the game's use of a computer game and the programmers' success in creating an animated cartoon character that closely resembles the original.  The review also mentions the use of a digital points display and a CU rating system.

91,"This page is a review of the video game ""Deja Vu,"" for the Commodore 64 and Amiga computer systems.

**Game Overview:**

The review describes ""Deja Vu"" as a ""most unusual adventure"" primarily controlled by a joystick.  It's a text-based adventure game, not an arcade-style game.  The game's interface uses three main windows: a graphics window showing the current location, a text window displaying narrative and messages, and an inventory window for collected items.  Verb boxes and an exit window are also part of the interface.  The game uses a point-and-click system, where the player uses a joystick to position an arrow on the screen and then presses a button to interact with objects or commands.

**Gameplay Details:**

The review highlights the game's unique gameplay mechanics.  The player navigates through the game by moving the arrow cursor and selecting verbs from the verb boxes.  The game allows for examining objects, opening windows (like a coat), and using items from the inventory.  The review notes that the game's vocabulary is limited to eight verbs, which can lead to a ""find/examine/do"" sequence of actions.  The review also mentions that the game's joystick-based control system can be challenging, particularly on the C64 version, due to the arrow's variable speed and the need for precise positioning.

**Review Ratings (C64 Version):**

The review provides ratings for the game's different aspects:

* **Graphics:** 9
* **Playability:** 7
* **Puzzleability:** 7
* **Overall:** 7

**Review Comments:**

The reviewer notes that the C64 version of the game has some quirks in its operation, particularly with the arrow's movement and the need for multiple clicks to execute actions.  However, the reviewer also praises the game's clever layout, controls, and boxes.  The reviewer concludes that the Amiga version of the game should be significantly better.  The review ultimately recommends the game as a worthwhile adventure.

**Game Details (from the review):**

* **Developer:** Keith Campbell, Mindscape/Mirrorsoft
* **Platform:** Commodore 64/128, Amiga
* **Price:** £14.95 (disk) / £29.95 (Amiga)


The page also includes screenshots of the game's interface, showing the different windows and the text-based commands.  The screenshots illustrate the game's graphics and the way the player interacts with the environment.

92,"This page is a section from a magazine, likely a gaming magazine, featuring reviews and information about video games.

**Venom (Mastertronic 64/128)**

The first section is a review of a game called ""Venom,"" published by Mastertronic.  The game is described as an adventure game, using a joystick for control.  The review mentions the game's alternative software (64/128) and price (£1.99).  The reviewer notes the game's screen layout, including location pictures, a scrolling commentary, selected word display, and verb and character icons.  The review also points out a significant flaw: the game's verbs are not all included in the list, and the layout is split into two blocks, requiring the use of a ""SCROLL"" icon to switch between them.  The reviewer criticizes the lack of fine control over the joystick, leading to frequent overshooting of targets.  The reviewer also comments on the game's plot, which is described as a ""boringly timeless setting"" reminiscent of Greek mythology and the Middle Ages.  The review concludes with a somewhat negative assessment, stating the game is ""virtually unplayable"" in places.

**Football Frenzy (Alternative Software)**

A separate section reviews a game called ""Football Frenzy.""  The reviewer notes the game's price (£1.99) and the alternative software it uses.  The review describes the game as a budget adventure with some graphical issues, where many pictures are clones.  The reviewer also mentions the game's instructions, which don't reveal much about the gameplay.  The reviewer's experience with the game is that it's not particularly engaging, and they didn't find anything compelling about the game.

**Code Section:**  The bulk of the page is a list of commands and numerical data.  Each line is numbered (e.g., 10, 20, 30, etc.).  The lines contain a combination of commands (e.g., ""REM"", ""FOR"", ""READ"", ""PRINT"", ""DATA"", ""SYS"") and numerical values.  The commands appear to be in a BASIC-like programming language.  The ""DATA"" lines contain a series of numbers separated by commas.  These numbers are likely the data that the program will use to modify the game's internal state.

**Specific Commands:**

* **REM:**  This is a remark or comment line, not executed by the program.  It indicates the author (D. Slack).
* **FOR...TO...NEXT:**  These commands likely define a loop that repeats a set of instructions.
* **READ...POKE:**  These commands likely read data from a list and modify the game's memory.
* **IF...THEN:**  This command creates a conditional statement, allowing the program to make decisions based on the values of variables.
* **PRINT:**  This command displays text on the screen.
* **SYS:**  This command likely executes a system call or subroutine within the game.
* **DATA:**  This command is used to store the numerical data that the program will use.

**Overall:** The page is a cheat code for a game, providing a way to modify the game's difficulty by granting infinite lives.  The format is typical of cheat cards for early home computers, using a list-based structure of commands and data.  The ""CU"" and ""cheatcard - no: 6"" at the bottom suggest this is part of a larger collection of cheat cards.
