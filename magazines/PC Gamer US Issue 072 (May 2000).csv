100,"This page is a review of the video game ""Virtual Pool Hall,"" published in PC Gamer magazine, May 2000.

The review is a critical one, with a final verdict score of 46%.

**Review Summary:**

The reviewer, Rob Smith, expresses disappointment with ""Virtual Pool Hall,"" describing it as a repackaged and slightly updated version of the older ""Virtual Pool 2"" game.  While acknowledging some improvements in the physics engine and AI, the reviewer criticizes the lack of innovation, repetitive gameplay, and poor music choices.  The game's ""spurious guarantees"" about improving one's pool game are also called into question.  The reviewer ultimately recommends sticking with the original ""Virtual Pool 2"" instead of purchasing ""Virtual Pool Hall.""

**Specific Points of Criticism:**

* **Lack of Innovation:** The game is essentially a rehash of ""Virtual Pool 2,"" with only minor additions.  The reviewer feels that the marketing hype about new features is misleading.
* **Poor Music and Atmosphere:** The reviewer notes the game's soundtrack and background environments as being uninspired and unengaging.
* **Limited AI Diversity:** While the game boasts a large number of AI opponents, the reviewer finds the AI's skill and variety insufficient.  The reviewer suggests that 30 AI opponents would have been just as diverse.
* **Snooker Rules:** The reviewer points out that the snooker rules are not accurately implemented in the game.
* **Unclear Physics Improvements:** While the physics are praised as accurate, the reviewer questions whether the game's physics actually improve one's real-world pool game.

* **Physics Engine:** The reviewer acknowledges that the physics engine is a strong point, accurately simulating pool shots.
* **Potting AI:** The reviewer notes that the AI is capable of potting balls, but not necessarily playing snooker correctly.

**Overall:**

The review paints a picture of a game that, despite some technical aspects, ultimately fails to deliver a compelling or innovative pool-playing experience.  The reviewer's disappointment stems from the game's lack of originality, poor presentation, and the feeling that it's essentially a repackaged older title. The low score reflects this overall negative assessment.

**Additional Information:**

The page also includes a brief description of the game's features, including the addition of other pool game types, and a visual representation of a pool table with balls in play.  There's also a recommendation for using Mike Sigel's video advice for pool shots, but with no explanation of how he performs them.

The reviewer highlights the game's low score and states that the game is a poor choice for players looking for a quality adventure game.

**Kenwood 72x True-X Review:**

The review gives a rating of ""Editor's Choice"" to the Kenwood 72x True-X.  The review highlights the drive's high speed (10MB/s transfer rate, less than 100ms random access), but notes that the advertised 72X speed is an average, not a maximum.

The review concludes with a ""Final Verdict"" section, listing pros (fastest CD-ROM drive available, overcoming past issues) and cons (not quite as fast as advertised, can be loud).  The overall recommendation is positive, suggesting it's a good choice for users who don't need a DVD drive.

The review also emphasizes the low 76ms random access time.  The review praises the kit's overall performance and the quality of the included decoder card, which allows for high-quality playback on various displays (PC monitors, TVs).  The ""Final Verdict"" section lists pros (fastest DVD-ROM drive, excellent decoder card) and cons (CD-ROM speed is not as high as the 40X maximum).  The overall recommendation is very positive, suggesting it's a great choice for users who need a DVD drive and want high-quality playback.

139,"This page is a review from PC Gamer magazine, May 2000, focusing on several new wargames. The article, titled ""Good Things in Small Packages,"" highlights the work of independent developers creating wargames, a genre that larger companies were seemingly abandoning.

The review covers four specific games:

* **Smolensk '41:**  This game, from HPS Simulations, is praised for its historical accuracy, focusing on the 1944 Smolensk campaign.  The reviewer notes the value for the money, with 19 scenarios and a large campaign (170 turns, covering 76,000 hexes).  The reviewer also mentions the game engine, which is derived from Talonsoft's Battleground series.  The reviewer finds the game's depiction of artillery, attrition, and the shock value of T-34s to be accurate and engaging.  The game is recommended for fans of 18th-century warfare.

* **Brigade Combat Team (BCT):** Developed by ProSim and distributed by Shrapnel Games, this game is the brainchild of Captain Patrick Proctor.  The reviewer notes the game's adaptation of the Pentagon's JANUS engine for the PC, resulting in admirable fidelity.  The game uses real-world contour lines instead of hexes, and the graphics are described as spartan and no-nonsense.  While the overall look and feel are authentic, the reviewer notes some rough edges and recommends further polishing, particularly in the manual and tutorials.  The price of $22.95 is considered attractive.  The reviewer warns that the game is challenging to master.

* **Red Thunder:** Developed by Edensoft, this game is described as ambitious but problematic.  It's a simulation of the 1944 Russian summer offensive.  The reviewer notes that only one operational scenario is currently available, but more are in development.  The game is compared to a classic board game, with a fluid ""blitzkrieg"" style, a large playing area, and creative touches like partisan operations and river crossings.  However, the reviewer criticizes the lack of a decent manual and the sparse online documentation.

* **Horse and Musket:**  This game, also from Shrapnel, is described as a worthy sequel to the classic Dragoon.  The reviewer praises the game's overall feeling of authenticity.

The overall tone of the review is positive, highlighting the value and quality of games from smaller, independent developers.  The reviewer acknowledges some shortcomings in certain games, but ultimately praises the developers' efforts and the potential of these games to fill a gap in the market left by larger companies.  The review rating isn't explicitly stated, but the overall impression is favorable, with recommendations for certain titles.  The page also includes a screenshot of a game in progress, showing a map and game interface.
