51,"This page is a review of the video game ""Draconia"" for the Amiga computer system.

The review, written by Mike Pattenden, gives the game a CU rating of 7.

The review begins by comparing the game to other arcade games, noting similarities to ""Darius Underwater"" and other classic coin-op titles.  The reviewer comments on the game's graphics, describing them as ""neat"" with ""witty, colourful backgrounds"" and some ""great aliens"" reminiscent of ""Xevious."" However, the reviewer feels the game's graphics are somewhat conventional and lack something special.

The sound is also criticized as ""disappointing,"" with a ""messy Xenon-style soundtrack"" and only a few sampled words.

The gameplay is described as ""a little slow"" and the method of collecting extra weapons, by continually shooting bonuses, is deemed ""fiddly.""  Despite these criticisms, the reviewer acknowledges that ""Draconia is still one of the better shoot 'em ups to have appeared on the Amiga.""  The review concludes by suggesting that the game is worth buying, if only for its ""outrageous insolence.""

The page also includes a visual representation of the game's gameplay, showing a section of the game's level with the game's characters and background.  There's also a digital points display with ratings for video, audio, toughness, endurance, and VFM (value for money)."

"
73,"This page is a black and white comic strip, likely from a magazine or anthology.  The style is gritty, with bold lines and a slightly exaggerated, almost cartoonish, depiction of characters.  The art style suggests a punk or alternative rock aesthetic.
