143,"This page contains a cheat card for the game Dan Dare II.  The cheat card provides a method to achieve infinite lives and a timer arrest feature.

The top section of the page describes the purpose of the cheat.  It explains that the player can keep losing lives or running out of time, and the cheat offers a solution.  The cheat involves typing in a series of commands, running them, and following on-screen prompts to load the game with the changes.  The cheat also allows the player to stop the timer at any time by pressing the RESTORE key.

The bottom section of the page contains the actual code for the cheat.  It's a series of commands written in a programming language, likely for a specific computer system (likely a Commodore 64 or similar).  The commands are numbered and include instructions like:

* **PRINT CHR$(147):FOR1=304T0371:READA$**: This is likely a command to print a character and loop through a range of addresses.
* **L=ASC(LEFT$(A$,1)):L=L-55:IF L<5 THEN L=L+7**: This command extracts the ASCII value of the first character of a string, adjusts it, and conditionally increments it.
* **R=ASC(RIGHT$(A$,1)):R=R-55:IF R<5 THEN R=R+7**: Similar to the previous command, but for the last character of the string.
* **V=(L*16)+R:C=C+V:POKEI,V:NEXT**: This command calculates a value, adds it to a variable, and stores it in memory.
* **IFC<>6392 THENPRINT""DATA ERROR!"": END**: This command checks a condition and prints an error message if it's not met.
* **PRINT ""SAVE LISTING FOR FUTURE USE""**: This command prints a message to the screen.
* **PRINT:PRINT ""SYS 304 TO START""**: This command prints instructions to the screen.
* **DATA 20,56,F5, A9, 4C, 8D,60,03,A9,45**: This and the following lines are data values that are likely used in the program.

The cheat card also includes a header that identifies it as a cheat card for Dan Dare II, and a footer that includes the cheat card number (29) and a logo (CU cheatcard).


The overall format is typical of a vintage computer game cheat sheet, with clear instructions and code snippets.

144,"The image is a promotional piece, likely a cover or part of a cheat sheet, for the video game ""Road Wars"" for the Commodore computer system.

The background is a vibrant, slightly desaturated orange-red.  A stylized graphic of lightning bolts in a pale yellow/cream color is prominently featured, extending across the lower portion of the image.  Overlaid on top of the lightning bolts are the bold, capital letters ""ROAD WARS"" in a black, sans-serif font.

Below the game title, the words ""CHEATCARD NO 30"" are printed in a smaller, similar font.  This indicates that this is a cheat sheet or guide for the game.

Beneath that, the words ""COMMODORE USER"" are displayed in a large, bold, white sans-serif font.  This clearly identifies the target platform as a Commodore computer.

The top portion of the image features a pixelated graphic of the game itself.  It shows a section of a road or track, possibly a futuristic or sci-fi environment, with a large, dark object (possibly a spaceship or similar structure) above the road.  The graphic also displays the text ""FLY/ SCORE 000000"" in a small, pixelated font, indicating a score display.  The pixelated graphics are in shades of orange, yellow, white, and black.  The overall impression is of a low-resolution, early 8-bit video game display.

The image is a clear representation of a promotional item for a Commodore game, specifically highlighting the cheat code or strategy guide aspect.  There is no review rating visible on the page.

145,"This page is a cheat card for the video game Roadwars.  It provides a set of commands and data to be entered into a computer (likely a Commodore 64, given the syntax) to enable infinite lives for both players in the game.

The cheat card instructions are as follows:

1. **Instructions:** The top section explains how to use the cheat.  Type in the provided listing, then run it.  Follow the on-screen prompts to load the game with infinite lives for both players.

2. **Code Listing:** The bulk of the page contains a series of BASIC commands.  These commands are designed to modify the game's data, enabling the infinite lives.  The commands include:
   * `PRINT CHR$(147)`: This likely sets up a special character.
   * `FOR...TO...NEXT`: These commands create a loop that iterates through a range of values.
   * `READ A$`: This command reads data from a data statement.
   * `ASC()`: This function converts a character to its ASCII value.
   * `LEFT$()`, `RIGHT$()`: These functions extract parts of a string.
   * `IF...THEN`: These commands create conditional statements.
   * `L=L+7`, `R=R+7`: These commands increment values, likely related to player scores or positions.
   * `V=(L*16)+R`: This calculates a value based on the left and right player values.
   * `POKE I,V`: This command writes a value to a memory location.
   * `IF C<>5177 THEN PRINT ""DATA ERROR!""`: This checks for a specific value and prints an error message if it's not met.
   * `PRINT ""SAVE LISTING FOR FUTURE USE""`: This is a message to the user.
   * `PRINT ""SYS 304 TO START""`: This command likely initializes the game.
   * `DATA`: These lines contain the data used by the `READ` commands.  The data appears to be hexadecimal values.

3. **Data:** The `DATA` statements contain a series of hexadecimal numbers (e.g., `20, 56, F5`).  These numbers are likely used to modify the game's internal state to achieve the infinite lives.

4. **Metadata:** The bottom of the page includes ""CU cheatcard - no: 30"".  This likely indicates the cheat card's source and a unique identifier.

In summary, this page is a cheat sheet for the game Roadwars, providing a set of BASIC commands and data to be entered into a computer to enable infinite lives for both players.  The instructions and code are specific to a particular computer system (likely Commodore 64) and game version.
