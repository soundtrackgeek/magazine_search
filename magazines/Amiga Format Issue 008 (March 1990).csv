54,"This page is a review of the video game ""Dragons of Flame"" for the Amiga computer system.  The review, written by Andy Smith, is part of a larger magazine article, ""Amiga Format,"" and appears on page 54.

The review includes a rating of 62% for the overall game.

**Game Overview:**

The review describes ""Dragons of Flame"" as an action role-playing game (RPG) in the style of ""Heroes of the Lance,"" part of a series of AD&D releases.  The game takes place in a mythical world 300 years after the gods abandoned the people of Krynn.  The Queen of Darkness, Takhisis, has awakened dragons and created an army of Draconians.  The player's party must fight against these forces, completing quests and tasks to defeat the enemy and save the land.

**Graphics and Sound:**

The graphics are described as basic, but reasonable, with overhead and side views of characters.  Sprite animation is quick.  Sound effects are limited and not noteworthy.

**Gameplay:**

The game features a party system with up to 10 companions.  The player can switch party leaders and encounter various enemies.  Combat involves either pressing a fire button and moving a joystick, or using a spell menu.  The game has a simple, easy-to-learn system, but the sheer number of enemies can make the game repetitive.  There are helpful items and goodies to be found, and the game includes a spell-casting screen.

**Control:**

The game supports joystick or keyboard control.  The game has two main movement modes: one that shows the party leader from the side, and another that shows the entire party from above.

The reviewer finds the game enjoyable at first, but the sheer number of enemies and repetitive nature of the gameplay eventually detracts from the experience.  While the game is easy to get into, it's not overly complex, and the role-playing elements are a nice addition to the hack-and-slash gameplay.  The game is considered a good introduction to the role-playing genre.

**Additional Information:**

The page also includes a screenshot of the game's interface, showing character portraits, a map, and the spell-casting screen.  There's a section on the game's price (Â£24.99) and the control methods (joystick or keyboard).

63,"This page is an article from *Amiga Format* magazine, likely from the 1980s or early 1990s, focusing on game programming techniques.  The article, titled ""The Whole Truth About Games Programming: 2,"" is a continuation of a series by Dave Jones, a programmer known for his work on games like *Menace* and *Blood Money*.

The article details the intricacies of scrolling in video games, specifically on the Amiga computer.  It breaks down the two primary methods: hardware scrolling and software scrolling.

**Hardware Scrolling:**

The article explains that the Amiga has a built-in hardware scrolling capability that shifts the entire display screen pixel by pixel, left or right, with minimal overhead.  This is a fast and efficient method, but it has limitations.

**Software Scrolling:**

Software scrolling, on the other hand, involves using the processor (or the blitter) to copy the display memory, shifting it to another part of memory.  This method is more complex but can be more flexible, especially when dealing with a large number of objects or more complex scrolling patterns.  The article emphasizes that software scrolling can save execution time when dealing with a large number of objects on the screen.

**Example: Menace Scroll:**

The article uses the *Menace* game as a practical example.  It describes the specific programming techniques used to manage the scrolling in *Menace*, including the saving and restoring of display memory to prevent ""trails"" of objects as they move.

**Pros and Cons:**

The article presents a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of each method.  Hardware scrolling is faster but less flexible, while software scrolling is more flexible but slower.

**Scenery Blocks:**

The article also discusses the technique of using ""scenery blocks"" to create more complex scrolling environments.  These blocks are 16x16 pixel graphics, each assigned a number, and are used to create larger, more varied backgrounds.  This method is described as a way to efficiently manage large amounts of scenery data in games.

**Hardware vs. Software Scroll Decision:**

The article highlights the crucial decision-making process in game design: choosing between hardware and software scrolling.  The choice depends on the specific needs of the game, balancing speed and flexibility.

**Overall:**

The article is a detailed technical explanation of scrolling techniques in game programming, aimed at a technical audience familiar with Amiga programming.  It provides practical examples and insights into the trade-offs involved in choosing between hardware and software scrolling methods.  The article is well-organized, using clear explanations and diagrams to illustrate the concepts.
"
64,"This page is a programming tutorial, specifically focusing on the scrolling mechanics of a game, likely Battle Squadron.  The tutorial details how the game utilizes a technique to scroll through a large amount of data efficiently, using the Amiga computer's hardware capabilities.

The tutorial is broken down into several sections, each explaining a different aspect of the scrolling process:

**1. Graphic Block Organization:** The tutorial begins by explaining how the game's graphic blocks are organized.  It notes that blocks that don't perfectly match are placed together, a quirk of the game's design.  Each block is composed of three planes, and the total memory required for a complete level is calculated.  The tutorial also highlights the unusual size of the game's map data file (5282 bytes) compared to the expected size for the number of screens it contains (roughly 19 screens).  The map data is organized as strips of bytes, with each strip representing a row of graphic blocks.

**2. Memory Requirements:**  The tutorial calculates the memory required for both the foreground and background of the game's playing area.  It emphasizes the need for memory to store two screens simultaneously to enable smooth scrolling.  The calculations show the total memory needed for the game's scrolling mechanism.

**3. Scrolling Technique:** The core of the tutorial is the explanation of the scrolling technique.  It describes how the game uses the Amiga's hardware scroll feature to shift the display pixel by pixel.  The tutorial explains that the game increments the bit plane pointers to scroll through memory, and how this is done in a way that allows for smooth scrolling.  It also explains how the game keeps new data coming onto the screen by drawing new strips of graphic blocks to the right of the current display area.

**4. Data Handling:** The tutorial explains how the game handles the data for the graphic blocks.  It describes how the graphic data for each block is stored in a file called FOREGROUNDS, and how each block is 96 bytes long.  It also explains how the game uses 16x16 blocks to create the scrolling effect.

**5. Screen Size and Pixel Arrangement:** The tutorial details the dimensions of the game's playing area (368 pixels wide x 192 pixels high), and how the background playfield is constructed similarly, but with an extra 32 pixels for clipping.  It also explains how the game's screen size is expanded to 352 pixels in length to accommodate the overscan effect.

**6. New 16x16 Blocks:** This section describes how the game uses new 16x16 blocks to create the scrolling effect.  It explains how the game draws strips of blocks into the screen, and how this is done simultaneously on both screens to create the illusion of smooth scrolling.

**7. Amiga Hardware:** The tutorial mentions the Amiga's hardware scroll and how it's used to achieve the scrolling effect.  It also highlights the hardware-assisted scrolling as a key part of the game's performance.

**Overall:** The tutorial is well-structured and provides a detailed explanation of the game's scrolling mechanism, focusing on the technical aspects of how the game manages memory and data to achieve smooth scrolling.  It's aimed at programmers or those interested in the technical details of game development.

83,"This page is an article review, specifically a review of Gold Disk's PageSetter 2 software for Amiga computers.  The review, titled ""Son of PageSetter,"" is by Jason Holborn and published in *Amiga Format* magazine, issue 83.

The review begins with an introductory paragraph highlighting the importance of Gold Disk's DTP software for Amiga users, and how PageSetter 2 is a significant upgrade from the original PageSetter.

The review then delves into a detailed analysis of PageSetter 2's features and functionality.  It discusses the following key aspects:

* **PageSetter 2's Mechanics:** The review praises the program's ability to create single-page documents in various sizes (A4 to B5, up to 8.5x14 inches).  However, it criticizes the limitation of not supporting multiple pages within a single document, which is a significant drawback for complex projects.

* **Page Layout and Frames:** The review explains how PageSetter 2 uses a frame-based layout system, similar to PageMaker.  It details how frames can be layered, moved, copied, and linked to create complex page designs.  The ability to flow text between linked frames is also highlighted.

* **Text Editing:** The review notes that PageSetter 2's text editor allows for direct typing on the page, unlike its predecessor.  This is a significant improvement, offering a more intuitive workflow.  It also mentions standard word processing features like search and replace.

* **Fonts:** A key improvement is the inclusion of AGFA/Compugraphic fonts.  These fonts are not standard Amiga fonts and are loaded on demand, as needed for display or printing.  The review notes that these fonts are a significant upgrade and that more are planned for future releases.

* **Overall Impression:** The review concludes by comparing PageSetter 2 to its predecessor and Pro Page.  It emphasizes the professional feel of PageSetter 2, while acknowledging its limitations in handling multi-page documents.  The review also mentions that the program is similar to Pro Page in many key areas, but functions as a distinct program.

* **Practical Application:** The review includes a visual example of an Amiga Format cover created using PageSetter 2, demonstrating the program's capabilities.  This visual aid helps readers understand the program's practical application.

The review is rated as positive, though it does point out some limitations.
