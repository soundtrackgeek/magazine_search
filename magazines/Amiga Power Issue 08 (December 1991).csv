30,"This page is a game review, specifically of Populous II, from a publication called Amiga Power, December 1991.  The review is spread across multiple sections, discussing graphics, gameplay, special effects, and comparing it to the original Populous.

**Graphics Section:** The review notes that the graphics are similar to the first Populous, but with a key change.  Instead of the ""book"" effect of the first game's map, the second game uses a ""slightly less obtrusive 'islands floating in the void' look.""  The layout of icons is also described as more logical, and the player can switch between a normal view and a full-screen view.  The review highlights that the in-game graphics are faster, more detailed, and more varied, with the addition of an actual historical time period, which gives the game more cohesiveness.

**Gameplay Section:** The review contrasts the gameplay of Populous II with the first game.  It mentions that Populous II has more worlds, varied enemy gods, and a significantly increased number of special effects.  The reviewer emphasizes that the gameplay is much faster, describing it as ""like it's been written by a real programmer.""  The review also points out that the creator, Peter Molyneux, attributes the faster gameplay and increased variety to a more sophisticated programming approach.  A key difference is the custom game option, which is new to the second game.  The review also notes that the effects are now more impactful, and that the game is more frantic, with the potential for effects to harm the player's own people as much as the enemy.

**Special Effects Section:** This section details the various special effects in the game.  It describes the effects in detail, including:
* **Volcano:** A devastating effect, sending streams of lava, sweeping buildings, and rendering the land infertile.
* **Tidal Wave:** Moves in all four directions, swallowing anything at ground level, unless it encounters land that's too high.
* **Whirlpool:** A powerful effect that eats its way into the land, like nobody's business.
* **Pimple Rocks:** Creates scattered rocks that are useless for building.
* **Plague:** A contagious disease marked by black crows, making the affected enemy infertile.

**Comparison to Populous I:** The review explicitly compares the two games, highlighting the differences in icons, updates, and the ""book effect"" versus the ""islands"" map style.  It also notes that the first game's effects are sometimes a ""double-edged sword,"" meaning they can harm the player's own people.

**Overall Impression:** The review concludes that Populous II is a significant improvement over the first game, with a more sophisticated approach to gameplay and special effects.  The reviewer highlights the increased variety and speed of the game, and the new custom game option.  The review also acknowledges the potential for frustration in the game's complexity, particularly when dealing with multiple effects simultaneously.  The review's overall tone is positive, emphasizing the game's competitive nature and its evolution from the first game.


The review is rated as a positive one, though the rating itself is not explicitly stated on the page.

43,"This page is a review of MicroProse Golf, a game for the Amiga computer, from Amiga Power magazine, December 1991.  The review, which takes up a significant portion of the page, is positive, though not without some caveats.

The review is structured around several key aspects of the game:

* **Graphics and Gameplay:** The reviewer praises the ""stunningly-executed 3D effect"" of the courses, which are depicted in vector graphics.  The camera's movement during gameplay, tracking the ball's progress across the landscape, is highlighted as impressive.  However, the reviewer notes a ""slightly carried away"" aspect to the graphics, specifically mentioning that while the panoramic view of the hole is detailed, the view during the actual swing is less so.  This is described as a ""cloak of light blue"" effect that obscures the foreground when the player is about to hit the ball.  The reviewer also points out the effective use of multiple camera angles.

* **Handicap System:** The review notes that the handicapping system is ""totally true-to-life, and hence horribly complex,"" but also acknowledges its potential to be a ""great leveller.""

* **Simulation Accuracy:** The reviewer questions whether the simulation of golf is the primary focus of the game, suggesting that the ""inherent attractiveness"" of the basic concept of golf is more important.  The reviewer believes the game's accuracy is not the primary focus.

* **Map Screen:** The map screen, which appears before each hole, is described as providing a comprehensive overview of the course, which can be rotated 90 degrees.

* **Other Features:** The review details various in-game elements, including icons for altering camera angles, wind strength and direction indicators, a ""close-up of the green"" feature that appears when the ball is near the hole, and a save feature for impressive shots.  The review also mentions the ""Last Shot"" feature, which allows the player to replay a previous shot.

* **Specific Examples:** The review includes visual examples of gameplay, such as a ""tricky shot behind a tree"" and a shot with a ""very steep slope.""

The review is rated as ""very good"" in the title, and the overall tone is positive, but with a few criticisms about the game's graphical limitations during the swing.  The page also includes screenshots and diagrams illustrating various aspects of the game's interface and gameplay mechanics.  The screenshots show the game's 2D and 3D elements, including the course layout, the player's character, and the various on-screen elements.

The review is structured into several sections:

**1. Introduction and Gameplay Overview (Angle Park):**

Screenshots illustrate these different perspectives.  The reviewer emphasizes the impressive visuals and camera angles.

**2. Review Body (Criticisms and Praise):**

The reviewer points out several areas where the game falls short, including:

* **Neglected Gameplay Mechanics:**  The reviewer criticizes the game's ball-hitting mechanism as ""over-fussy"" and the circular bars as unnatural.  The aiming system is also deemed confusing, with the 3D perspective making it hard to judge shot accuracy.  The greens are described as ""intangible,"" with the grid lines making them appear flat, leading to inconsistent shot outcomes.  The game's reliance on pre-determined actions, rather than player control, is also noted as a drawback.
* **Sound and Presentation:** The reviewer notes the sound as unimaginative and the overall presentation as lacking in some areas.
* **Positive Aspects:** Despite the criticisms, the reviewer acknowledges the game's strong points, including the accuracy and depth of options, which are typical of MicroProse games.  The reviewer also praises the game's enjoyable gameplay despite the flaws.

**3.  Specific Gameplay Examples:**

**4.  Summary and Conclusion (Ups and Downs):**

The review concludes with a summary of the game's strengths and weaknesses.  The ""Uppers"" section highlights the game's ease of access and the variety of gameplay options.  The ""Downers"" section lists the game's shortcomings, including the inconsistent detail, the front-end presentation, and the sound.  The ""Bottom Line"" section provides a concise evaluation, praising the game's technical aspects and playability but noting that other games, like PGA Tour Golf, offer a superior experience in terms of sheer enjoyment.

**Overall:**

The review presents a balanced assessment of ""Angle Park,"" acknowledging both its strengths and weaknesses.  While the game is technically impressive and playable, the reviewer feels that other games in the genre offer a more enjoyable experience.

**Shadow Sorcerer:**

* **Summary:**  The review describes *Shadow Sorcerer* as a different type of game, focusing on a D&D-style experience with computer-assisted control over four animated characters.  The reviewer notes the 3D isometric representation of the play area and the use of a hex map to depict the progress of the heroes.

**7 Colors Review:**

* **Reviewer:** Stuart Campbell
* **Rating:** 12%
* **Summary:** Campbell describes the game as ""bizarre, complex, French, and definitely, definitely featuring more than six colours."" He highlights the game's graphics and demanding experience, but criticizes the lack of gameplay. He finds the game's difficulty and lack of explanation frustrating.  He concludes that the game is ""literally incredible"" in its execution of a poor concept.

* **Reviewer:** Jonathan Davies
* **Rating:** 47%
* **Summary:** Davies' review is more mixed. He acknowledges the game's diamond-based puzzle mechanics and addictive nature in the early stages. However, he notes that the game's success relies heavily on luck and the initial layout of the screen, rather than skill.  He finds the game becomes repetitive and boring after a few plays.  He concludes that the game is ""sort of alrightish"" but not worth the price.


**Shadow Sorcerer Review:**

* **Reviewer:** Mark Ramshaw
* **Rating:** 71%
* **Summary:** Ramshaw's review is more positive. He praises the game's graphics, plot, and control system, which he finds different from typical hack-and-slash games. He notes the game's 3D isometric view and animated cameos. However, he criticizes the game's disjointed structure, constantly switching between map and action views, and the feeling that it tries to be too many things at once.

He concludes that while the game has good points, it's not as good as Beholder and that the D&D fans might look for something more ambitious.
