34,"This page is a game review for a game called Overdrive, published in Amiga Power magazine, November 1993.

The review, written by Stuart Campbell, gives the game a 46% rating.

**Review Details:**

The reviewer begins by criticizing the game's presentation, noting that the track design lacks a sense of scale and immersion. The scanner feature is deemed useless, and the screen space could be better utilized.  The music is also criticized, stating that it loses its energy and becomes repetitive after a few laps, becoming distracting.

The gameplay itself is described as having a decent feel, but the control options are problematic.  One control scheme is considered confusing and unintuitive.  The difficulty curve is deemed reasonable, but the reviewer finds the eight-lap races to be excessively long and tedious.  The reviewer also points out that the game's track layout is overly simplistic, with all corners being 90 degrees, which limits the track's variety and interest.

The reviewer contrasts Overdrive unfavorably with other similar Amiga racing games, highlighting their superior graphics, variety, and playability.  Games like Nitro, Champion Driver, and Supercars 2 are mentioned as better alternatives.

* **""The Bottom Line"" section:** This section reiterates the overall negative impression of the game, stating that it's unsatisfying and that the flaws are significant enough that even an A1200 (a powerful Amiga computer) couldn't fix them.
* **""Practice Mode"" and ""Players"" sections:** These sections show the game's practice mode and player statistics, including the best lap time and player names.
* **""It's nice to have two options"" section:** This section features a banner with a cartoon character and text highlighting the game's two control options.

The reviewer also points out that the game's structure involves a mix of real-time and frozen-time gameplay, which can be both a strength and a weakness, depending on the player's preference.

**Gameplay Description:**

The review describes the gameplay as a strategy combat game where players control Space Marines (Terminators) in a derelict spaceship.  The goal is to defeat Genestealers, alien creatures that inhabit the ship.  The game features a planning screen where players can set the paths of their Terminators, and a freeze-time option that allows for strategic planning during combat.

**Knights of the Sky:**

The review for ""Knights of the Sky"" focuses on the realism and fun aspects of the game.  The reviewer notes that while the technology behind the game may have taken away some of the fun of aerial combat, the game's design is still enjoyable.  The reviewer highlights the detailed graphics, head-up display, and missile targeting system.  The reviewer also points out the realistic (and somewhat frustrating) handling of the planes, which requires skill to control.

116,"This is an advertisement or promotional material for the video game ""Jurassic Park,"" likely for a 1990s console release.

The image is dominated by a large, stylized graphic of the Jurassic Park logo, featuring a Tyrannosaurus Rex silhouette.  The background is a sunset over a tropical scene, with palm trees.

The text prominently displays the game title ""JURASSIC PARK"" in large, bold letters.  Below that, the tagline ""WHEN THE STREET JUST AIN'T TOUGH ENOUGH... GO PLAY IN THE PARK"" is written in a larger, more emphatic font.  The text also includes the phrase ""IF IT'S NOT JURASSIC PARK IT'S EXTINCT.""

There's a section dedicated to a ""Gameplay Helpline,"" with a phone number (0839 654154) and instructions for obtaining permission to call.  This suggests a paid service for assistance with the game.

The advertisement also lists the game's availability on various platforms, including PC compatibles, CBM Amiga, Game Boy, Super Nintendo, and Nintendo Entertainment System.

The bottom of the page includes the company name, Ocean Software Limited, and their contact information (address, telephone, and fax number).

A small section at the top right corner, in a smaller font, appears to be a preview or a review section for the next issue of a magazine (likely a gaming magazine).  It mentions ""NEXT MONTH!"" and discusses the upcoming issue's content, including reviews of games.  The tone is somewhat humorous and opinionated.

Finally, there's a small, humorous graphic at the bottom right corner, which seems to be a technical issue or a joke about the image printing process.  It says ""Oh no! The picture's stuck! I can't get it off! Help! Help!"""
