125,"This page is from a magazine article, likely PC Gamer, reviewing educational software.  The article focuses on a program called ""No More Mr. Potty-Mouth,"" and discusses the appropriateness of humor in children's software.

**Review of ""No More Mr. Potty-Mouth"":**

The author, Heidi E. H. Aycock, expresses mixed feelings about the program.  While acknowledging that the program's ""giggles"" and ""humor"" were initially appealing, she criticizes the program's reinforcement of potentially inappropriate behaviors, such as slapstick humor involving characters fighting on the floor.  She also notes the program's slow pace and confusing graphics compared to other electronic books.  The author highlights the program's use of ""nasty smells"" on a farm as an example of potentially inappropriate humor.

**Specific Concerns:**

* **Inappropriate Humor:** The author feels the program's humor is inappropriate for children, particularly the slapstick and crude humor.
* **Slow Pace and Confusing Graphics:** Compared to other electronic books, the program's graphics are described as slow and confusing.
* **Reinforcement of Inappropriate Behavior:** The author suggests the program might reinforce behaviors that parents are trying to discourage, such as hitting, yelling, and inappropriate language.

**Comparison to Other Programs:**

The author contrasts ""No More Mr. Potty-Mouth"" with other programs, noting that some programs tread close to the line of inappropriate humor but don't cross it.  She uses examples like ""Harry and the Haunted House"" and ""Kid Phonics"" to illustrate this point.

**Overall Tone:**

The author's tone is critical, but not entirely negative.  She acknowledges the program's entertainment value for some children, but ultimately questions its educational value and appropriateness.

**Additional Information:**

The article also mentions other programs, like ""Alphabonk Farm,"" and discusses the difficulty of defining acceptable humor in children's software.  The author's personal experience with her son and the program is central to the review.

**Review Rating:**

While not explicitly stated as a numerical rating, the overall tone of the review suggests a negative or mixed assessment of the program's appropriateness and educational value.
"
126,"This page is an article from PC Gamer magazine, May 1995, discussing the appropriateness of humor in educational software for children.  The article is a review, though not of a single product, but rather a general commentary on the issue.

The article is structured around a series of points, each addressing a different aspect of the issue.

**Section 1:  Introduction and Initial Concerns**

The opening paragraphs express concern about the increasing use of slapstick comedy and bathroom humor in educational software. The author argues that some parents may find this type of humor inappropriate for children.

**Section 2:  Parental Perspectives and Responses**

The author outlines four points to consider when evaluating educational software with potentially offensive humor:

1.  **Tolerance Levels:**  Parents should not overreact to humor they find objectionable, but rather use their judgment to determine if the humor is appropriate for their children.
2.  **Communication with Developers:** If a parent is offended by a product, they should contact the company to express their concerns.
3.  **Setting Limits:** Parents should establish clear boundaries for their children regarding the types of humor they are exposed to.
4.  **Contextual Understanding:**  Humor should be evaluated in context.  For example, imaginary characters interacting in a playful way might be acceptable, while the same humor in a real-life situation might not be.

**Section 3:  Specific Example and Personal Anecdote**

The author uses the example of a software program called ""Alphabonk Farm"" to illustrate their point.  They describe the program as being too scary for their child, and they express frustration with the program's humor.  They also share a personal anecdote about a stranger offering their child a cookie, which they felt was inappropriate.

**Section 4:  A Broader Perspective on the Issue**

The author argues that while some parents might find the humor in educational software objectionable, many other parents and children may find it acceptable.  They also suggest that the software industry should consider the potential for offense and provide ways for parents to review the software before purchase.

**Section 5:  Conclusion and Final Thoughts**

The author concludes by stating that children can influence adult attitudes, and that the software industry should consider this.  They also suggest that the industry should find ways to engage children without resorting to offensive humor.

**Overall Review Rating:**

There isn't a single review rating for a specific product. The article is a commentary on a broader issue, not a review of a particular software program.  The author expresses frustration with the humor in one specific program, but the overall tone is more about the need for better communication and consideration between parents and software developers.

130,"This page is an article from PC Gamer magazine, dated May 1995, titled ""The Death of Role Playing?"".  The article is a review/opinion piece by Trent C. Ward, who is the ""Alternate Lives"" columnist.  The overall tone is one of concern and perhaps a bit of pessimism about the future of role-playing games (RPGs) on the PC.

The article opens with a paragraph discussing the changing landscape of the PC gaming industry, noting that game companies are producing more titles than ever before, with larger budgets and more advanced tools (like FMV and 3D modeling).  However, the author argues that this trend is negatively impacting the RPG genre.

The article then delves into the specific challenges facing RPG developers.  It highlights the significant time and effort required to create a high-quality RPG, including designing complex levels, writing detailed dialogue, and playtesting extensive gameplay.  The author points out that the sheer complexity of RPGs often makes them less commercially viable compared to other genres, like action games, which can be developed and released more quickly.

The article also touches on the issue of player expectations.  The author argues that players have come to expect longer games with more complex storylines and features, and that many current RPGs fall short of these expectations.

The author also discusses the changing strategies of some companies.  They are moving away from traditional RPGs towards other genres, like space simulators, to attract a wider audience.  This shift, according to the author, is a worrying trend for the RPG genre.

The article concludes with a personal opinion from Trent C. Ward, who expresses concern about the possible demise of the RPG genre.  He hopes that his concerns are unfounded and that the RPG genre will continue to thrive.  The article's rating is not explicitly stated, but the overall tone suggests a critical, yet hopeful, perspective on the future of RPGs.
