**Positive Aspects:** The review acknowledges the game's technical competence in terms of graphics and sound, but these are not enough to elevate the experience.

* **Rating:** ★★
* **Review Summary:** The review criticizes the game, calling it a ""total and complete crap"" that's a rip-off of the rave scene.  The reviewer compares the game unfavorably to other, more enjoyable, games.  The graphics are described as awful, and the gameplay is likened to simple puzzle games involving moving objects on a board.  The reviewer suggests the game is aimed at young children, but that's no excuse for its poor quality.  The verdict is that the title is a cash-in on the rave scene, but not a good one.

**Texas Chainsaw Massacre (BSY):**

* **Rating:** ★★
* **Review Summary:** The review is critical of the game, comparing it unfavorably to the horror movie it's based on.  The reviewer finds the game's gameplay simplistic and uninspired, describing it as ""shaky"" and ""offensive.""

**Fighting Warriors (Excalibur PD):**

* **Rating:** ★★
* **Review Summary:** The review is more mixed, acknowledging the impressive animation and controls.  However, the reviewer finds the game repetitive and pointless, with the same actions and moves repeated over and over.

The verdict is that the game is technically impressive but lacks substance and depth.

**CLI-Tris (Alpha PD):**

* **Rating:** ★★
* **Review Summary:** The review describes the game as ""pretty, flashing colors"" and reminiscent of 1960s psychedelia.  However, the reviewer finds the game a poor imitation of Tetris, with jerky graphics and a lack of engaging gameplay.
