**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing ""Wetlands"" as a gritty, Cyberia-style shooter, developed by New World Computing and published by the same company.  The game's objective involves locating a fugitive in a secretive underwater world, with a ruthless madman plotting to destroy the world. The game blends a stylized, two-dimensional comic book aesthetic with 3D environments.

The review also points out that the game's interactive elements, such as the onboard computer, are insufficient to compensate for the demanding levels.

213,"This page is a review of the video game ""Fighter Duel"" from PC Gamer magazine, January 1996.

The review is structured as follows:

**Game Overview:** The review begins by describing the game as a flight simulation, developed by Jaeger Software and published by Philips Media.  It highlights the game's focus on dogfights and its required hardware (CD-ROM drive, 486/33 processor, 8MB RAM, SVGA with 1MB VRAM).  The recommended configuration is also mentioned (486/66, sound card, joystick, modem). The suggested retail price is $49.95.

**Review Content:** The review praises the game's modem play, stating that it makes the game worthwhile.  It notes that the game lacks a campaign or war mode, focusing solely on dogfights.  The review mentions the game's selection of 13 vintage fighter planes (P-51D Mustang, F6F Hellcat, British Spitfires, Corsairs, FW-190, and Japanese Zero).  The reviewer highlights the realistic flight models, calling them the most realistic in any sim.  The graphics are described as superb, with texture-mapped 640x480 resolution and adjustable graphics options to maintain a high frame rate even on less powerful 486 machines.  The reviewer also notes the lack of ground detail, which helps maintain a high frame rate.  The sound effects are also praised, ranging from the engine's throaty growl to the thumping action of the machine guns.

**Single-Player vs. Multiplayer:** The review contrasts the single-player and multiplayer aspects of the game.  The single-player mode is criticized for its lack of a compelling campaign, with the computer-controlled planes lacking the intelligence expected by most sim fans.  The reviewer notes that the computer-controlled planes are not very challenging, especially at lower skill settings.  In contrast, the multiplayer mode is praised for its head-to-head dogfighting, where players can match wits with other human pilots.  The reviewer emphasizes the game's strength lies in its ability to allow players to engage in dogfights with other players via modem.

**Final Verdict:** The review concludes with a final verdict score of 84%.  The positive aspects of the game are highlighted, including the outstanding two-player dogfighting and excellent frame rate on modest systems.  The negative aspects are also mentioned, such as the weak single-player game and lack of a campaign mode.  The bottom line is that the game is a good choice for modem dogfighters but not for those seeking a deep single-player experience.

218,"This page is a review of the video game ""Burn Cycle,"" published in PC Gamer, January 1996.

**Review Summary:** The review gives the game a 71% rating.  While praising the cyberpunk atmosphere, soundtrack, and complex storyline, the reviewer criticizes the game's graphics (described as ""sometimes chunky"") and linear plot.  The reviewer finds the blend of puzzle-solving, arcade action, and cyberspace elements to be a mixed bag, appealing to casual gamers but not necessarily die-hard adventure fans.

**Game Overview:**

* **Category:** Action Adventure
* **Developer:** Trip Media
* **Publisher:** Philips Media, Inc.
* **Price:** $49.99
* **System Requirements:** Double-speed CD-ROM drive, 486/33 or better processor, 8MB RAM, Windows 3.1 or later, Windows compatible sound card, and a mouse.  Recommended configuration is 486/66 or better, Windows 95.

**Review Details:**

The review begins by describing ""Burn Cycle"" as a cyberpunk thriller, but one with more style than substance compared to other similar games.  The game's plot involves a courier, Sol Cutter, who downloads a data packet containing a virus that will kill him in two hours.  The review highlights the game's use of full-motion video sequences, similar to ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" but also points out that the game incorporates elements of classic adventure games (character interaction, item acquisition) and arcade-style sequences.

The reviewer notes that the game's interface, using a Myst-like style of rendered still screens, is sometimes a distraction from the story.  The reviewer also points out that the game's plot is linear and that the arcade sequences feel out of place in the overall narrative.  While the game's atmosphere is praised, the reviewer notes that the game's puzzles, while better than those in ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" aren't quite enough to keep the player engaged.  The review concludes by stating that the game's blend of puzzle-solving, arcade action, and cyberspace elements might appeal to casual gamers but not necessarily die-hard adventure fans.

**Technical Aspects:**

The review mentions the game's graphic quality, ranging from colorful rendered screens to dark, moody full-motion video sequences.  The reviewer also notes the game's complex storyline and the presence of a great soundtrack.  The review also points out the game's linear plot and the occasional feeling that the game is doing the thinking for the player.

**Overall:**

The review provides a balanced assessment of ""Burn Cycle,"" acknowledging both its strengths (atmosphere, soundtrack, complex storyline) and weaknesses (graphics, linear plot, sometimes disjointed gameplay).

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing the game as a sports simulation, developed by Mindspan and published by Accolade.  It highlights the game's strong arcade-style action, but notes that the statistics are unrealistic for hardcore fans.  The required hardware and recommended specifications are listed.

**Review Content:**

The review is divided into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the game:

* **Graphics and Gameplay:** The reviewer praises the game's beautiful graphics, particularly the stadiums and player models.  However, they criticize the cartoonish and unrealistic look of the players during gameplay.  The reviewer also notes the arcade-style action as a strength, but points out that the game's focus on arcade action comes at the expense of realistic statistics.

* **Gameplay Mechanics:** The review discusses the game's features, including the ability to play exhibition games, create leagues, and manage teams.  It highlights the improved team management options and the addition of a home run hitting contest.  The reviewer also mentions the presence of 12 classic teams from the past.

* **Statistics and Realism:** The review is critical of the game's unrealistic statistics.  The reviewer notes that the game's statistics don't accurately reflect real-world performance, and that the computer-controlled teams often produce overly offensive results.  This is a recurring theme throughout the review.

**Rating and Verdict:**

The review gives HardBall 5 an 86% rating, classifying it as an ""Excellent"" arcade game with improved league play and modern options.  However, the review also points out the game's weakness in realistic replay statistics.  The bottom line is that while the game is fun, it's not a realistic simulation of Major League Baseball.

Tomcat Alley is highlighted for its higher video frame rate, near-VHS quality video, and joystick controllability.

A small blurb at the bottom of the page states that Sega is a registered trademark, and that Comix Zone, Ecco the Dolphin, and Tomcat Alley are trademarks of Sega.  It also includes the copyright date (1995), Sega's address, and a product information number (177).
