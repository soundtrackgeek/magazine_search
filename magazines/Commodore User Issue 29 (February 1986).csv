"
40,"This page is an advertisement and article from a magazine, likely *Commodore User*, focused on Commodore 64 programming.

The top section features a graphic of a hand, stylized to look like magic, and a large, stylized headline ""Comp"".  Below this, a smaller text box explains that this is a monthly column, ""Computer Magic"", by resident programmer Phil Cornes, offering programming tricks and tips for the Commodore 64.

The main body of the page describes a technique for saving and recalling old programs.  It explains that when a BASIC program is deleted (either by pressing the reset button or typing NEW), it's not truly removed from memory; it's just made inaccessible.  The article details a method to make these programs accessible again, using a special ""OLD"" program.

This ""OLD"" program is a single BASIC line embedded within a REM statement.  Crucially, this line must be the first line of any program you want to be able to recall.  The line contains a REM statement, followed by 31 spaces, and then a closing quote.  The article provides a specific example of the data to be loaded into memory, using the POKE command, to create this ""OLD"" program.

The article then explains how to use this technique.  It states that if you run a program with this ""OLD"" program as the first line, and if there are no errors, the program will copy the OLD code over the REM statement spaces and then delete all the program except line 1.  This allows you to save and recall the original program later by using the LIST command.

Finally, the page provides a complete listing of the data needed to create the ""OLD"" program.  This is presented as a series of DATA statements, each containing a sequence of numbers.  The article concludes by stating that the provided listing is the ""OLD program listing"".

There is no explicit review rating, but the content is instructional and promotional, aimed at Commodore 64 users interested in programming techniques.
"
41,"This page is from a vintage computer magazine, likely *Computer Magic*,  featuring a technical article on programming for the Commodore 64.

The article focuses on two main topics:

**1. Freeze a Listing Program:**  This section describes a program designed to pause the display of a listing program on the Commodore 64.  The author explains that the standard listing feature scrolls too quickly to be easily read, and this program provides a solution.  It utilizes a small block of memory (between addresses 679 and 767) and a vector at address 774 to achieve this.  The program also leverages the Commodore 64's keyboard commands (SHIFT, CTRL) to trigger the freeze function.  The article provides a complete listing of the program code, including `FOR`, `NEXT`, `POKE`, `PEEK`, and `DATA` statements.  The code is presented in a numbered format, making it easy to follow.

**2. Loony Tunes (Sound Program Optimization):** This section addresses the efficiency of creating sound programs on the Commodore 64.  The author notes that typically, each note in a sound program requires two data values.  The article presents a program that converts a single number (representing a note from 1 to 96) into the two data values needed for the Commodore 64's sound output.  This significantly reduces the amount of data required to create a sound program.  The article provides a listing of this program, again using `POKE`, `READ`, `DATA`, and other Commodore 64 commands.  It also includes a table mapping numbers 1-96 to the corresponding musical notes (C, C#, D, etc.) and their octave.

The page layout is typical of a magazine article from that era, with clear headings, numbered code listings, and explanatory text.  The use of `POKE`, `PEEK`, `DATA`, and other Commodore 64-specific commands indicates the target audience is experienced Commodore 64 programmers.
