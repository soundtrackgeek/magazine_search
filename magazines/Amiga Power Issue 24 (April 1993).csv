The poster features a stylized, dark-toned graphic of a creature, possibly a dragon or a mythical beast, in a circular shape. The creature's image is rendered in a textured, mottled gray-silver color, giving it a distressed or aged appearance.  The creature's wings and body are depicted in a flowing, dynamic style.  The background is a dark navy or black color.

Overlaid on the creature image, the band name ""Dark Mere"" is prominently displayed in a large, stylized, metallic-looking font. The letters are a mix of gold/orange and gray/silver, with a textured, cracked effect.

The overall design is dark, dramatic, and evokes a sense of mystery and impending doom, fitting with the genre of music often associated with the band name.  The style of the graphic and the text suggests a heavy metal or gothic rock aesthetic.

56,"This page is a game review for ""Lemmings 2 - Tribes,"" likely from a magazine like Amiga Power.

The review, spanning a significant portion of the page, discusses the game's plot, gameplay mechanics, and overall experience.

**Plot Summary:** The game revolves around evacuating an island using a giant flying boat.  Different tribes of lemmings must collect talisman pieces to power the boat.  Crucially, the player doesn't have to complete the levels in a specific order, allowing for flexibility and retries.

**Gameplay Mechanics:** The review highlights the game's structure as a work of genius, allowing for a flexible approach to level completion.  Unlike the original Lemmings, where success or failure was absolute, Lemmings 2 offers varying degrees of success.  The player has a limited number of lemmings per tribe, and the number saved in one level carries over to the next.  Completing levels with a specific number of gold medals earns a gold talisman piece, while silver or bronze medals result in corresponding talisman pieces.  This system encourages players to experiment and try different approaches.  The review also mentions the ability to replay completed levels to get more lemmings.

**Review Rating (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated as a numerical rating, the review expresses a positive opinion of the game, praising its flexibility, difficulty, and user-friendliness.  The reviewer highlights the game's ability to challenge players without being overly frustrating.

A final section mentions the presence of a ""Medieval world"" soundtrack.

The page reviews two games: *Hero Quest* and *Videokid*.

**Hero Quest Review:**

* **Publisher:** Gremlin
* **Price:** £9.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Rating:** 86% (Highly Recommended)
* **Review Summary:** The review praises *Hero Quest* as an excellent game, appealing to both fans of the original board game and newcomers.  It notes the game's engaging gameplay, which involves a board-game-style interface with a spinning coin to determine movement.  The reviewer highlights the variety of quests, the ability to play up to four characters, and the saving of characters and their accumulated items.  While acknowledging some minor criticisms (the later quests being slightly harder, and the lack of animation for spell casting), the reviewer concludes that the game is a very absorbing board game conversion.

**Videokid Review:**

* **Publisher:** GBH Gold
* **Price:** £9.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review Summary:** The review describes *Videokid* as a platform game with a somewhat flimsy storyline.  The game involves a player character who is drawn into a video game by a magician.  The gameplay is described as involving floating around, blasting enemies, and using power-ups.  The reviewer notes that the scrolling screen can trap the player, and that the game's emphasis is on blasting enemies.  The review doesn't give a numerical rating, but the reviewer does mention that the game is a ""cutesy platform game"" at first glance.

**General Information:**

The page also includes a brief introductory section about ""budget"" games, highlighting that some games are less expensive than ""full price"" ones.

**Terminator 2 (The Hit Squad):**

* **Rating:** 30%
* **Review:** Jonathan Davies criticizes the game, calling it a ""good conversion of the film"" but ultimately a disappointing experience.  He finds the game's gameplay repetitive, with eight levels, three of which are identical, and the shooting sections are poorly designed.  The game's strengths are limited to the digitised stills and animated sequences from the film, which are described as ""quite impressive.""

**RBI Two Baseball (The Hit Squad):**

* **Rating:** 61%
* **Review:** Tim Norris gives a more positive review, calling it ""one of the better baseball sims.""  He acknowledges the game's strengths in its presentation (looks good, sounds okay) and its entertainment value as a two-player game.  However, he criticizes the game's single-player mode, stating that the computer's flawless performance makes it frustrating and unenjoyable.  The review highlights the game's cute animations and scoreboard displays.

**Action Sports (Microids):**

* **Rating:** Not explicitly stated, but the review is positive overall.
* **Review:** The review by Jonathan Davies praises the game's fluid animation and realistic player appearances.  He notes the ""neat touches"" like the winner tossing their racket in the air.  However, he also points out the unusual control scheme, where the computer handles most of the action, and the occasional frustration of the game not quite doing what the player intends.  The review mentions four games in the ""Action Sports"" compilation, and while all are competent, none are outstanding.
