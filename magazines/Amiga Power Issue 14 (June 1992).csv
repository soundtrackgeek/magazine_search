The Navigator receives a 3/2-3-2 overall score, with low marks across the board.

**ZOOMER Euromax Joystick (Â£59.95):**

This section reviews the Zoomer Euromax joystick.  The review notes a significant flaw: the joystick lacks a clamping mechanism, relying instead on suction cups.

The article is a review/guide, focusing on the definition of sound in flight simulators.  It's not a traditional review in the sense of rating a specific game, but rather a general overview of the flight simulation genre and its evolution, with a particular focus on the Amiga platform.
