The Navigator receives a 3/2-3-2 overall score, with low marks across the board.

The page showcases four different joysticks:

1. **Professional 9000 Deluxe (Euromax £13.99):**  The review describes it as having Rapid Fire, but a stiff feel.  The reviewer questions the use of meaningless numbers in the product name.  The review notes the joystick's clicking action and suitability for older games requiring precise controls.  The review gives a durability rating of 5 stars, ease of use 3 stars, sore hands factor 2 stars, and an overall rating of 5+3-2=6.

2. **Mach 1 Microswitch Joystick (Cheetah £12.99):**  The review highlights the joystick's long name and simple design.  It has four easily accessible fire buttons with autofire.  However, the reviewer notes a flimsy feel and questions its longevity.

4. **Analog Plus Joystick (Suncom £27.99):**  This joystick is described as an American-style analog joystick with a strange addition to the Amiga's digital arsenal.

**ZOOMER Euromax Joystick (£59.95):**

This section reviews the Zoomer Euromax joystick.  The review notes a significant flaw: the joystick lacks a clamping mechanism, relying instead on suction cups.  This makes it difficult to keep the joystick securely in place while using it.

The article is a review/guide, focusing on the definition of sound in flight simulators.  It's not a traditional review in the sense of rating a specific game, but rather a general overview of the flight simulation genre and its evolution, with a particular focus on the Amiga platform.
