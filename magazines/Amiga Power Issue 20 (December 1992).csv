The review details a game called ""Humans,"" published by Mirage Designs and developed by Imagitec.  The game is priced at £25.99 and is described as a puzzle game in the style of Lemmings, set in prehistoric times.  The player controls a tribe of humans, guiding them through levels to achieve goals like discovering tools and fire.  The game involves platforming, problem-solving, and resource management.

**Review Content:**

The review, written by Dave Golder, gives a mixed assessment of the game.  The reviewer highlights the interesting premise of the game, comparing it to the 2001 film and the concept of human evolution.  The reviewer notes that the game's mechanics, such as the need to swap disks and the awkward control system (a mix of joystick and keyboard), detract from the experience.  The reviewer also points out that while the graphics are colorful, the dinosaurs and other creatures are not as well-executed.

**Review Details:**

* **Game:** Tiny Skweeks
* **Publisher:** Loriciel
* **Price:** £25.99
* **Release:** Out now

**Review Summary:**

The reviewer, Richard Longhurst, gives the game a 68% rating.  While acknowledging the game's cute graphics and characters, the review criticizes the lack of a compelling plot or engaging gameplay beyond the puzzle elements.  The reviewer finds the game mildly interesting but ultimately not particularly engrossing.  The core gameplay involves moving colorful creatures (skweeks) to specific pads on a grid-based level, with time limits and varying difficulty.  The review highlights the repetitive nature of the gameplay and the lack of a strong narrative or compelling reason to continue playing.  The reviewer also notes the game's reliance on clichés and the lack of a truly addictive quality.

**Game Description (from the review):**

The game features cute, furry characters, and spells, but the plot is described as ""irrelevant"" to the gameplay.  The goal is to move the skweeks to the correct pads within a time limit.  The skweeks only move in straight lines and stop when they hit a wall or object.  The levels are single-screen and involve varying numbers of colored skweeks.  The skweeks need to be moved to traps of the same color.  The game has 101 levels, with different themes and bonuses.  There are also cuddly characters and a time limit.

**Additional Features Mentioned:**

* **Sound Effects:** Described as ""irritating""
* **Translation:** The review notes a ""duff"" translation on the game's box.
* **Gameplay Mechanics:**  The review details the various ways to interact with the skweeks (e.g., stamping, crushing, shooting, sending to sleep).
* **Levels:**  The game has multiple levels, each with a different theme.
* **Time Limit:**  A significant aspect of the gameplay is the time limit imposed on each level.
* **Puzzle Elements:** The game is primarily a puzzle game, with the skweeks needing to be moved to the correct traps.
* **Extra Lives/Codes:** The game offers extra lives, but the codes are not explained.
* **Scoring:** The review notes that there is no scoring system.

**Overall:**

The review concludes that ""Tiny Skweeks"" is a fun little game, but not one that will hold players' attention for long.  It's suitable for those looking for a simple puzzle game but not for those seeking a more engaging or complex experience.
