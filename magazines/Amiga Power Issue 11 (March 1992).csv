* **Publisher:** Software Projects
* **Price:** Â£9.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review Summary:** The reviewer, Stuart Campbell, describes the game as ""moderately entertaining"" but notes that it lacks depth and excitement.  While the graphics are improved, the gameplay is repetitive and the wandering around without much action is a drawback.  The bigger graphics make it harder to get a clear idea of the map's layout, reducing the atmosphere.  The reviewer suggests it might be interesting for a short time, but not worth the price for long-term enjoyment.

**Thunderstrike:**

* **Review Rating:** 77%
* **Publisher:** GBH
* **Price:** Â£7.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review Summary:**  The reviewer praises the fast-paced, groovy shoot-'em-up gameplay with lots of action.  The 3D landscape is impressive, but the repetitive nature of the gameplay is mentioned as a potential drawback.  The reviewer finds the game enjoyable for quick blasts, but lacks depth.

**Mindbender:**

* **Review Rating:** 70%
* **Publisher:** GBH
* **Price:** Â£7.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review Summary:** The reviewer compares the game to the Gremlin's puzzler Deflektor, highlighting the similar puzzle-solving elements.  The game is described as a ""better buy than many other ordinary budgies"" and a ""historical artifact.""  While the contoured landscape is impressive, the reviewer notes that the bad guys are few and far between, making the game slow and dull at times.  The reviewer concludes that it's a success in its field, but lacks depth.

* **Release:** Out now
* **Review:**  The review describes Quattro Fighters as a compilation of four previously released games (Mig 29 Soviet Fighter, Kamikaze, SAS Combat Simulator, and Guardian Angel) bundled together for a lower price point than buying them individually.  The reviewer notes that the games are cheaper than many other similarly priced products.  The review highlights that Mig 29 Soviet Fighter is an Afterburner clone, while Kamikaze is a vertically scrolling shoot-'em-up similar to Flying Shark.  SAS Combat Simulator is described as a basic horizontally scrolling beat-'em-up, and Guardian Angel is a simple beat-'em-up with some humorous touches.  The reviewer finds the games to be a good value, but notes that the gameplay might not be exciting for everyone.  The review concludes with a ""Bottom Line"" rating of 80%.

**Ultimate Golf:**

* **Publisher:** GBH
* **Price:** Â£9.99

However, the reviewer points out that Ultimate Golf is more expensive than its competitor, World Class Leaderboard, and that the latter is the better game.  The reviewer criticizes the game's presentation, sound effects, and animation as lacking in quality.

* **Publisher:** Hi Tec
* **Price:** Â£7.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review:** The review describes Future Basketball as a basketball game that is similar to Speedball 2, but without the ""no-contact"" rules.

The review concludes with a ""Bottom Line"" rating of 63%.
