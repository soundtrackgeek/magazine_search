The bunker is filled with robotic henchmen and the player must penetrate all layers, locate a missile containing a deadly virus, and deactivate it.  The game's instructions are sparse, relying on a debriefing from a previous mission survivor, making the gameplay a ""find out how to play as you go"" experience.  The player must learn to navigate the bunker's various locations, or ""quadrants,"" each with its own challenges and robotic enemies.  The player's immunity level and weaponry are crucial to success, as each quadrant is contaminated by Dr. Megalomann's proprietary virus.

**Review Content:**

The review, written by Christina Erskine, gives a detailed assessment of the game.  The reviewer notes that the game is ""nicely put together"" with a good amount of tension in the gameplay.

85,"This page is a review of a computer game called Diablo, published by Robtek/Diamond Games.  The review, written by Christina Erskine, gives the game a 4 out of 10 overall rating.

**Game Overview:**

The review describes Diablo as a sliding block puzzle game for the Amiga computer.  The game involves a grid of squares with a track that a ball follows.  The player must manipulate the squares to keep the track continuous and guide the ball through the grid.  The game features ""series"" screens, which use the same grid pattern, and ""random"" screens, which generate a new grid pattern each time.

**Gameplay Analysis:**

The reviewer notes that the gameplay is based on the sliding block principle, and is intended as a mental exercise.  However, the reviewer finds the game repetitive and boring, especially after a few levels.  The reviewer criticizes the lack of variation in the grid patterns across different levels, stating that the game doesn't offer much challenge beyond the initial stages.  The reviewer also points out that the ball moves slowly, and the ""hyper-ball"" option, while speeding up the ball, is only useful for long stretches of clear track.

**Graphics, Sound, and Value:**

The review includes separate sections for graphics, sound, toughness, endurance, and value, each rated on a scale of 1 to 10.  The overall ratings for these aspects are not explicitly stated, but the reviewer's overall impression is negative.

**Conclusion:**

The reviewer concludes that while the game might have been considered innovative a few years prior, it doesn't showcase the Amiga's capabilities.  The reviewer finds the game repetitive and ultimately uninspired.

**Technical Details:**

The page also includes screenshots of the game's interface, showing the game's menu, in-game graphics, and score display.  The game's price is listed as £19.95.  The page also includes a description of the game's screen layout and gameplay mechanics.

The reviewer also points out that the game's puzzles are not particularly well-integrated into the overall experience.  The reviewer finds the opening sequences to be the game's strongest point, but the rest of the game falls short.
