The article opens with a brief introduction highlighting the date (August 25th) and the excitement of getting a new Windows 95 system.  It acknowledges that there aren't many new games specifically designed for Windows 95 yet, and that many users will need to run older DOS games.  The author notes that while Windows 95 is designed to work with DOS programs, the method of launching them might be different.

A small image of a Windows 95 desktop with a DOS game's title screen (likely *Heretic*) is included.  The image is accompanied by text that further explains the need to learn new rules for running DOS games under Windows 95.

The article promises to provide solutions and instructions in the following pages.  The article's title and the accompanying image clearly indicate the content's focus on running DOS games on Windows 95.  The page number (59) and magazine name (PC Gamer) are also visible, providing context for the publication.

The overall tone is informative and helpful, addressing a common problem for users transitioning to Windows 95.  There's no review rating present on this page.
"
62,"This page is from a computer magazine, likely PC Gamer, from September 1995.  It's a section detailing how to use Windows 95 to manage DOS games.  The specific focus is on the ""Properties"" dialog box for a DOS game, ""Heretic.""

The page describes how to access the properties of a DOS game's .EXE file within Windows 95 using the Explorer or My Computer interface.  It explains that right-clicking the .EXE file and selecting ""Properties"" or highlighting the file and choosing ""Properties"" from the File menu will open the dialog box.  The article also mentions that if the game is already running, using Alt+Enter will put it in a window, allowing access to the properties.

The page shows a screenshot of the ""Heretic Properties"" dialog box.  The dialog is divided into sections (tabs) with the first one, ""General,"" being skipped over as it's considered informative only.  The ""Program"" tab is highlighted and described in detail.

The ""Program"" tab allows the user to:

1. **Specify the .EXE filename:**  This is the command line entry.
2. **Change the working directory:**  This sets the DOS current directory for the game.
3. **Add a batch file:**  This allows the user to specify a batch file to run before the game starts.
4. **Create a shortcut key:**  This lets the user assign a keyboard shortcut to start the game.
5. **Choose how the game runs:**  The user can choose to run the game normally, minimized, or maximized.
6. **Specify whether the game closes on exit:**  This is recommended to avoid lingering windows.

The page also includes a brief explanation of the ""Advanced"" button, noting its importance in setting program properties.  The article emphasizes that this is how Windows knows where to start the program.

The page also shows a list of files in a file explorer window, including ""Flyingh2.gif,"" ""Heretic.cfg,"" ""Gargoyle.exe,"" and others.  These are likely files associated with the Heretic game.

The article explains that this setting controls how much CPU time the DOS game gets when the user isn't actively interacting with it.  A higher setting gives the DOS game more priority, potentially slowing down Windows, but improving the game's performance.  The ""Background"" option determines whether the DOS game continues running in the background even if minimized or switched away from.  Other options include ""Allow screen saver,"" ""Exclusive mode,"" and ""Termination"" settings.

**2. Screen Properties:** This section lets users choose between full-screen and windowed modes for DOS games.  The article notes that many DOS games don't run well in windowed mode, so full-screen is often preferred.  There are also options for ""Fast ROM emulation"" and ""Dynamic memory allocation.""  The article recommends leaving these options checked, as they can improve performance.

**3. Font Properties:** This section allows users to select the font type and size used within the DOS application.  The article states that this setting is less critical and can be left at the default.

The required specifications are listed as: Double-speed CD-ROM; 386SX or faster; 555K conventional memory; Supported sound card.  The recommended specifications are: 486DX2/50; 8MB RAM.

The review itself is critical, giving the game a 60% rating.  The reviewer, John Robinson, begins by comparing the game to the classic arcade game ""Dragon's Lair,"" noting similarities in its cartoon graphics and sound.  However, the review quickly turns negative, highlighting the game's frustrating gameplay.

The reviewer points out several issues:

* **Linear gameplay:** The game's path is very linear, with wrong turns leading to instant death.  This is illustrated with examples like encountering tiger statues that spring to life and kill the player.  There's no real strategy or exploration.
* **Repetitive and frustrating:** The reviewer emphasizes the repetitive nature of the game, with similar encounters and frustrating trial-and-error gameplay.
* **Inconsistent character interaction:** The interactions with characters are described as inconsistent and sometimes unclear.  The reviewer mentions a specific example of a wise woodsman who tells the same story repeatedly.
* **Lack of depth:** The reviewer concludes that the game lacks depth and feels lifeless, despite the good sound and music.

The review concludes with a final verdict, highlighting both the positive aspects (good sound and music) and the significant negative aspects (repetitive, frustrating, and arbitrary gameplay).  The overall impression is that the game, while visually appealing in its cartoon style, ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying gaming experience.  The reviewer suggests that the game wasn't made by people who play games.
