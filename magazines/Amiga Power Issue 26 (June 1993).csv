The review is presented in a layout typical of a magazine article, with various sections and graphics.

* **Rating:**  The review is mixed, with the reviewer expressing frustration with the Amiga's performance and the game's difficulty.  The reviewer describes a struggle to progress through the game, highlighting a specific challenging section that took two hours to complete.

"
76,"This page is a review of the video game ""Battle Squadron,"" published by Global, and reviewed in Amiga Power magazine, June 1993.

The review, by Stuart Campbell, gives the game a 70% rating.  The review is quite lengthy and detailed, discussing various aspects of the game.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by noting the game's place in a series of similar vertically-scrolling shoot-'em-ups, including ""Hybris,"" ""Wings of Death,"" and ""Lethal Xcess.""  It highlights the game's graphical style, which is described as ""8-bit beyond belief,"" despite the reviewer acknowledging the graphics are attractive.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

The review emphasizes the unique power-up system.  Players collect power-ups from defeated enemies, and the type of power-up collected determines the type of weapon upgrade.  If the player collects the same type of power-up, the weapon upgrades to a more powerful version.  However, if a different type of power-up is collected, the weapon reverts to the lowest level of that type.  This system is described as ""weird"" and impacting the game's balance.  The reviewer also notes the difficulty, stating that the enemies are more intelligent than in other similar games, and that the game can become frustratingly difficult.

**Review Summary:**

The review concludes that while the game is technically sound and well-made, the power-up system and lack of character make it less compelling than other similar games.  The reviewer compares it unfavorably to ""SWIV"" and ""Sky High Stuntman,"" but still places it in the ""League of Vertically-Scrolling Shoot-'Em-Ups.""

**Additional Sections:**

There's also a separate section by Mark Winstanley, who gives a different perspective on the game.  He emphasizes the game's slow pace and lack of excitement, calling it ""slow"" and ""laughable.""  He advises players to avoid the game if they are looking for arcade-style action.

**Technical Information:**

The page also includes details about the game's publisher (Hit Squad), price (£9.99), and release date (Out now).  There are also screenshots and images of the game's gameplay.

**Other Notes:**

The page also includes a brief review of a different game, ""The Enforcer Mach 9,"" and a section about the magazine's test-driving of a vehicle.  The page also includes a humorous anecdote about a character trapped in a mine shaft.
"
77,"This page is a section from a magazine, likely an Amiga Power issue, featuring game reviews.  It showcases two game reviews: ""Storm Master"" and ""Populous and the Promised Lands.""

The reviewer highlights the game's slow performance and flickering graphics.  The review also touches on the game's storyline, describing it as ""crazy-mad"" and ""completely potty.""  The reviewer notes the game's graphics are ""lovely"" but that the game is ultimately a lot of work for little reward.

* **Rating:**  Mixed, with some positive aspects but also significant criticisms.
* **Publisher:** The Hit Squad
* **Authors:** Bullfrog
* **Price:** £12.99
* **Release:** Out now
* **Review Content:** The reviewer notes the game's unusual premise, where the player controls flying boats in a wind-driven world.  They mention the ability to customize the fleet and the strange battle system.  The reviewer also points out the game's limitations, such as the lack of a league system and the limited number of teams.  The review highlights the game's graphics as ""lovely"" and the ""huge amounts of statistics"" involved.  The reviewer concludes that the game is best suited for those who enjoy ""shoot-'em-up"" games and ""juggling numbers.""

**Additional Information:**

* **""The Bottom Line"" sections:**  Both reviews include a concise summary of their opinions, highlighting the key pros and cons of each game.
* **""The Bottom Line"" for Populous:**  The reviewer suggests the game is best described as a ""football management game"" rather than a traditional adventure or wargame.
* **""The Bottom Line"" for Storm Master:**  The reviewer recommends avoiding the game.

Overall, the page presents two contrasting game reviews, offering detailed insights into the gameplay, graphics, and overall experience of each title.
"
78,"This page from Amiga Power magazine, June 1993, features reviews and a comic strip.

**Strike Fleet Review:**

The review for ""Strike Fleet"" is given a rating of 75%.  The reviewer, Mark Winstanley, describes the game as a modern-day naval battle simulator where players control a fleet of up to 16 vessels.  The game is praised for its intuitive mouse-controlled gameplay, offering a comprehensive overview of the battlefield through two well-presented screens: a map screen and a bridge screen.  The reviewer highlights the game's ability to control the entire shooting match from a single screen, showcasing the programmers' thoughtful design of the game mechanics.  The reviewer also notes the game's ability to split the fleet and send ships individually.  The graphics are described as excellent, with realistic depictions of water splashes and smoke plumes.  However, the reviewer points out a minor drawback: the graphics window size, which might feel a bit cramped.  Overall, the review concludes that the game is a solid choice for naval simulation fans, but the price point of £12.99 might be considered high for a re-release.

**Populous Review:**

The review for ""Populous"" is given a rating of 75%.  The reviewer, Mark Winstanley, notes that this is a re-release of the game, and the ""Promised Lands"" data disk only offers different character sets rather than new challenges.  The reviewer suggests that for the price, a second-hand copy of the original game might be a better value.

**The Bottom Line (Strike Fleet):**

A separate ""Bottom Line"" section for ""Strike Fleet"" gives the game a 90% rating.  The reviewer praises the game's smooth gameplay, comparing it to a ""Shetlands coastline"" in terms of its slickness.  The reviewer also notes that the game is entertaining and will keep players engaged throughout the night.  The review mentions that fans of Tom Clancy's works would likely enjoy this game.

**Soccer Kid Comic Strip:**

A comic strip titled ""Soccer Kid"" is also featured.  The strip depicts a character named Soccer Kid who is trying to find the World Cup.  He seeks the help of a Belgian detective, and the comic features dialogue and illustrations.
