**Review Details:**

The review gives the game a 61% rating, indicating a somewhat average or below-average score.  The reviewer criticizes several aspects of the game:

* **Graphics:** While acknowledging that the graphics might suit fans of ""heavy breathers and gore,"" the reviewer notes that many aspects of the visuals are not clearly visible.
* **Gameplay:** The game's use of five disks for the game is cited as a major problem, leading to frequent swapping and slow gameplay.  The reviewer also points out that the need to access disks before each move slows down the experience.
* **Story and Design:** The reviewer finds the game's plot and character development to be somewhat weak, with the game's ""frustration"" being heightened by the graphics.  The reviewer also notes that the game's success depends on persistence and luck.
* **Combat:** The reviewer notes that the combat system is frustrating, as fighting with a dagger requires more blows than necessary.  The lack of visual guidance during combat is also a problem.
* **Adventure Elements:** The reviewer notes that the game has a role-playing element, but that the majority of the game is focused on the adventure aspects.
* **Length:** The reviewer notes that the game requires a significant amount of time to complete, and that the repeated deaths and slowness of the game make it less enjoyable.

86,"This page is a review of the video game ""Carthage,"" published in *Amiga Format* magazine, February 1991.  The review, written by Andy Hutchinson, gives the game an 82% rating.

The page is formatted with a large, pixelated image of a map of Carthage and surrounding areas, along with a smaller image of a Roman soldier.  The text is presented in columns, with graphics interspersed throughout.

**Game Overview:**

The review begins by describing the game's premise:  Diogenes, a Phoenician hero, must lead Carthage to victory against the Romans in the Punic Wars.  The game is a strategy game where players must manage resources, build armies, and strategically position troops on a 3D map to defeat the Romans.  The review highlights the importance of financial management, as the Phoenician trading fleet is crucial for funding the war effort.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

The review details the key gameplay elements, including:

* **Chariot Sequences:**  These are arcade-style sequences where the player controls a chariot, navigating a road filled with obstacles (logs, rocks) to collect money.  The player must steer the chariot and manage its speed to avoid damage and collect resources.
* **Army Management:** Players must create armies, allocate resources, and move troops across the 3D map.  The map displays the location of cities, troops, and Roman forces.
* **Battles:**  When Roman forces catch up to the player's troops, battles commence.  Players must deploy cavalry, infantry, or elephants to engage the enemy.
* **Ben Hur-style Confrontations:**  If the player encounters another chariot on the road, a confrontation ensues, similar to the movie *Ben-Hur*.  The player must ram the other chariot to win.
* **Map Navigation:** The map is a 3D representation of the area, allowing players to see the entire country, including forts and cities.  Players can move armies by clicking on their icon and dragging it to the desired city.

**Review Highlights:**

The review praises the game's graphical presentation and arcade sequences, which add excitement to the strategy gameplay.  However, it notes that the arcade sequences alone might not appeal to all gamers, particularly those who prefer pure shoot-em-up games.  The review also mentions the game's historical background, which adds depth to the experience.

**Review Verdict:**

The overall verdict is positive, awarding the game an 82% rating.  The review concludes that ""Carthage is a well-presented graphical strategy game"" with arcade sequences that make it more engaging than a purely strategic game.  However, it also notes that the game's appeal might be limited to strategy game fans.

135,"This is a review of the ""Mugician"" soundchip tune creator software for the Amiga computer, published in *Amiga Format* magazine in February 1991.  The review, by Jon Bates, gives a detailed look at the software's capabilities and features.

**Product Overview:**

The product is described as a self-contained Paula-playing sequencer that can also manipulate and create its own waveforms.  It allows users to create tunes and play them back using the Amiga, and generate sounds for those tunes.  The software is similar to Soundtracker, using a series of patterns ordered into a song by a master sequencer.  A key feature is the ability to input notes directly from the QWERTY keyboard.

**Review Content:**

The review is structured around different aspects of the software:

* **Interface and Functionality:** The review highlights the main screen, which is the primary interface for interacting with the program.  It notes that the program's functions are accessible via simple buttons.  However, the review also points out a significant issue: the lack of named patterns or instruments unless saved as disk files.  The reviewer found it necessary to sketch songs on paper to keep track of the patterns.  The ""Making Waves"" section describes the waveform and sample editing capabilities, emphasizing the detailed and flexible nature of the waveform creation options (32 waveforms).

* **Sound Capabilities:** The review details the software's sound manipulation features, including smart routines that affect waveform length, volume, and pitch.  It also mentions the ability to add effects to sound samples and create custom waveforms.  The reviewer notes the extensive control options for sound manipulation, including looping, cutting, pasting, pitch shifting, filtering, and reversing.

* **MIDI Connection:** The review discusses the software's MIDI capabilities, noting that it accepts MIDI note commands and can play up to four separate samples on different MIDI channels.  However, it also points out limitations, such as the inability to recognize pitchbend or velocity commands.  The reviewer acknowledges the software's ability to turn the Amiga into a tone module using MIDI commands.

* **Ease of Use:** The review describes the software's ""A La Carte"" interface, which lacks menus and relies on icons to navigate between screens.  The pattern editor is highlighted as a key feature, allowing for up to 64 steps per pattern.  The reviewer notes the presence of editing, speed, and instrument controls.  The review also mentions the quantize option, which rounds up played notes to the nearest step, but notes the absence of a metronome or beat indicator.  The reviewer also points out a software crash issue when loading demo tunes.

* **Hearing Voices:** This section focuses on the software's ability to play multiple voices within a single pattern, the various effects available for each note, and the ease of applying these effects.  The review highlights the usefulness of effects like pitchbend, note wander, speed alteration, and arpeggios.

**Review Rating (Implicit):**

While not explicitly stating a numerical rating, the review presents a balanced assessment of the software.  It highlights both the strengths (powerful sound manipulation, MIDI capabilities, and ease of use for certain tasks) and weaknesses (lack of named patterns, software crash issues, and lack of a metronome).  The overall tone suggests a positive view of the software's value for money, particularly for experienced programmers, but also acknowledges limitations for beginners.

148,"This page is a review of the Prodata database program for the Amiga computer, published in Amiga Format magazine in February 1991.

The review, written by PAT McDONALD, describes Prodata as a companion to the popular Protext word processor, both developed by Arnor.  It's presented as a disk-based database, storing data in a file on disk, which can be a significant factor in performance, especially with large databases.

**Review Summary:**

The review gives Prodata a mixed rating. While praising its excellent documentation and powerful features for large databases, it criticizes the program's speed, particularly when using floppy disks.  The review notes that the program is not intuitive for new users, requiring a learning curve.

**Key Sections and Details:**

* **Introduction:** The review begins by contrasting Prodata with its companion program, Protext, highlighting Prodata's focus on disk-based database functionality.  It emphasizes that Prodata is a different product, despite its similarities to Protext.

* **Interface and Usability:** The review describes Prodata's interface as ""mundane,"" lacking the intuitive menus of other Amiga programs.  It notes the use of a simple front-end menu system, with submenus and requesters appearing as the user progresses.  The reviewer also points out that while the mouse can be used, keyboard shortcuts are often faster.  The lack of graphics in the text menus is also mentioned.

* **Performance:** The review notes that the program's speed is poor when using floppy disks, but good with hard drives.  The reviewer also points out that the minimum and maximum sizes of records mean only one record can be seen at a time.

* **Data Handling:** The review highlights Prodata's ability to handle large databases, storing data in files on disk.  It also mentions the program's ability to use up to 20 filters to select records.

* **Specifications:** A table details the maximum capacity of Prodata, including text field length, fields per record, indexes, layouts, filters, and variables.

* **Hands-On:** The review discusses the program's printer support, noting that it doesn't use standard Amiga printer drivers, instead relying on preset printers.  It mentions compatibility with Epson and Diablo printers.

* **Verdict:** The review concludes with a verdict section, summarizing the program's purpose, speed, documentation, accessibility, value, and features.  The overall assessment is that Prodata is a powerful tool for large databases, but its learning curve and speed limitations are significant drawbacks.  The review highlights the program's excellent documentation and features, but notes that it's not cheap.

* **Price:** The price of the program is mentioned as £79.95.

* **Author and Publisher:** The author of the book used in the database example is mentioned, along with the publisher.

The page also includes screenshots of the Prodata program's interface and menus, providing visual context to the review.
