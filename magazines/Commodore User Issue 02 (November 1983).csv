56,"This page is a section of a larger publication, likely a computer magazine or catalog, focused on Commodore 64 software and hardware.  It features a review of ""Super Screen,"" a program by Audiogenic.

**Review of Super Screen:**

The review, written by Colleen Young, discusses a program called ""Super Screen"" that allows a Commodore VIC-20 to display 40 columns of text instead of the standard 40.  The review highlights the following:

* **40-column display:** The program allows for a wider display, useful for applications needing more information on a single screen.
* **Loading and relocation:** The program loads normally and relocates to the top of memory, configuring the screen for 40 columns.
* **Color options:** The program supports eight colors, but only one color can be displayed at a time on a single line of text.  The review notes that lighter colors (white, cyan, green, and yellow) are more legible than darker ones.
* **Character set:** The full character set and screen editing functions are retained.
* **Limitations:**  The review points out that it's not possible to use the POKE command to directly change screen locations or colors.  Also, printing 40 characters or less on a line results in the next line being blank.
* **Demonstration program:** The review praises the included demonstration program, showing the program's capabilities.
* **Potential uses:** The review suggests potential uses for the program, including databases, word processing, and spreadsheets.
* **Value for money:** The review concludes that, given the price (£9.95), the program is a reasonable value for applications needing more information on a single screen.

This section answers a reader's question about the WAIT state in Commodore 64 programming.  It clarifies the bitwise operations involved, specifically how the AND and XOR operations are used with masks.  The explanation is detailed and technical, explaining the logic behind the operations.

**Section 4: Two's Complement and Negative Numbers:**

This section explains the concept of two's complement in binary arithmetic and why it's used to represent negative numbers in computers instead of a sign bit.  It provides a clear example of converting a binary number to its two's complement.

**Section 5: Disabling the RUN/STOP and RESTORE Functions:**

This section addresses a reader's request to disable the RUN/STOP and RESTORE functions in Commodore 64 BASIC.  The author explains that the RESTORE command triggers a non-maskable interrupt (NMI), which is difficult to disable.  The solution involves modifying the NMI vector, which is a low-level programming technique.

**Section 6: VERIFY Command in Immediate Mode vs. Program Mode:**

This section explains the behavior of the VERIFY command in Commodore 64 BASIC.  It highlights the difference in how the command behaves when used in immediate mode (typing it directly into the command line) versus when it's part of a program.  The author explains why the messages ""SEARCHING"" and ""FOUND"" might not appear when the command is run within a program.

**Section 7:  Program Compatibility and PEEK/POKE:**

The final section discusses the compatibility of BASIC programs with the Commodore 64.  It notes that programs with many PEEK and POKE commands might require more effort to convert to other Commodore models.
