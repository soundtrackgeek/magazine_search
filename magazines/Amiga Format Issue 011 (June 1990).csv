This quote, likely part of the article's introduction, suggests the unpredictable nature of complex systems, a key concept related to fractals.

The article then delves into the concept of ""Chaos and Order,"" explaining how science tries to break down the natural world into individual systems that are expected to behave in ordered ways.  However, it also notes that some systems are chaotic, and how a system can suddenly flip from one state to another.  The example of a singer with a microphone, amplifier, and speakers illustrates how feedback can lead to a chaotic state (a screeching or howling sound) when the gain is increased beyond a certain point.

The article also mentions a biologist, P. F. Verhulst, who studied species population in the 1840s.  This example illustrates how natural systems, like rabbit populations, also have feedback loops and can exhibit chaotic behavior.

Finally, the article states that all the fractal images in the article were created using Tim Moore's program.  The background images are crystal structures, courtesy of the Science Photo Library, and the cover picture is a micrograph of menthol crystals.  This indicates that the article is likely from a magazine or publication that includes visual elements.

The article then introduces the topic of budget-friendly 9-pin printers, noting their ability to produce high-quality output.  The author, Simon Williams, is credited with the review.

The body of the review discusses the features and benefits of entry-level 9-pin printers, emphasizing their convenience, speed, and quality.  It mentions the capability of these printers to handle NLQ (Near Letter Quality) text and graphics.  The article also highlights the improvements in these printers over time.

Crucially, the article emphasizes that the printers are reviewed in ascending order of price, allowing readers to compare value for money.  It also advises readers that the quoted prices are recommended retail, and that discounts of up to 40% are often possible with some shopping around.

"
32,"This page is a review of two printers, the Amstrad DMP 3160 and the Mannesmann Tally MT81.  The review is likely from a computer magazine or similar publication, judging by the layout and format.

**Amstrad DMP 3160 Review:**

The review details the Amstrad DMP 3160's design philosophy, focusing on its cost-effectiveness and radical design choices.  It highlights the printer's flat-bed printing technology, which eliminates the need for a platen, saving on cost and complexity.  However, the review also points out drawbacks:

* **Difficult ribbon mounting:** The vertical downward printing mechanism makes mounting the ribbon challenging.
* **Short ribbon life:** The short ribbon length necessitates frequent replacements.
* **Basic controls:** The control panel is described as basic, with limited guidance for continuous paper use.
* **Uneven print quality:** The review notes a very uneven NLQ font, with some characters not properly rendered.
* **Slow speed:** The printer is significantly slower than other models.
* **Limited graphics capabilities:** While the printer claims compatibility with Epson and IBM standards, it can only print some of the Epson graphics characters.

**Mannesmann Tally MT81 Review:**

The review of the Mannesmann Tally MT81 emphasizes its solid reputation in Europe and its neat design.  Key features highlighted include:

* **Quiet operation:** The printer is described as quiet with the covers in place.
* **Neat design:** The top covers conceal the printer's workings, contributing to a clean aesthetic.
* **Noise reduction:** The ""mute"" mode helps reduce noise.
* **Efficient paper handling:** The push-feed tractor is more efficient than pull-feed systems, and the auto-loading and auto-parking features are well-regarded.
* **Solid build quality:** The printer is described as reliable and built for commercial use.

**Criticisms of the MT81:**

* **Poor manual:** The review criticizes the manual's poor layout, lack of index, and use of multiple languages, making it difficult to use.
* **Awkwardly placed controls:** The dip switches are positioned inconveniently under the print carriage.
* **Limited character set indication:** The manual does not clearly indicate which characters the printer can produce.

**Overall:**

The review provides a detailed comparison of the two printers, highlighting both their strengths and weaknesses.  The Amstrad DMP 3160 is presented as a cost-effective but somewhat flawed machine, while the Mannesmann Tally MT81 is praised for its build quality and quiet operation but criticized for its confusing manual.

"
35,"This page is a product review section, likely from a magazine or similar publication, comparing two printers: the Epson LX-400 and the Citizen 120-D.

**Epson LX-400:**

* **Price:** Â£199
* **Model Number:** 0442 61144
* **Description:**  The Epson LX-400 is described as solid, heavy, and built to last.  Its design is neat and square.  While the single-sheet guide is convenient, the detachable pull-feed tractor is considered somewhat cumbersome.  The printer's top surface has a removable cover that protects the gear mechanism.  The pull-feed tractor makes paper-feeding less convenient, requiring the removal of the mechanism to refit the single-sheet guide.  The control panel on the right of the carriage has three membrane switches for line feed, form feed, and on-line functions.  These switches also have secondary roles in controlling the SelecType system for setting type styles (emphasized and condensed).
* **Features:** The printer uses a pull-feed tractor, which is a drawback for continuous stationery.  It's faster than other printers reviewed, and its NLQ characters are described as ""notchy,"" particularly around ""o's"" and ""Q's.""  It provides both serif and sans-serif fonts, including an NLQ version of the draft font.  The printer emulates Epson control codes thoroughly, extending to the full ASCII character set between 128 and 159 (including musical note, telephone, and card suit symbols).
* **Drawbacks:** The pull-feed tractor is considered a negative aspect, as it wastes paper and is more fiddly to load.  The review notes that the manual lacks details on control codes.

**Citizen 120-D:**

* **Price:** Â£229
* **Model Number:** 0895 72621
* **Description:** The Citizen 120-D is described as the lightest of the tested printers, with a small footprint.  It has a detachable pull-feed tractor mounted behind the platen.  The front panel has three spongey buttons for on-line, line feed, and form feed functions.  The form feed button also acts as an auto-load, aligning single sheets.  The printer comes with no interface.
* **Features:** The printer has an excellent manual with lucid sections on use and reference.  It includes details of standard Epson and IBM control codes and a thorough index.  It uses a pull-feed tractor.  The print speed is similar to other printers reviewed.  The draft text is described as ""spidery.""  The printer is lightweight and can reproduce Epson extended graphics characters, but not all IBM characters.
* **Drawbacks:** The printer's odd shape is mentioned as a drawback.  The review notes that the printer's interface system uses plug-in cartridges.

**Overall:**

The page provides a detailed comparison of the two printers, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.  The reviews include sample printouts to demonstrate the quality of the output.  The page also mentions the availability of a 120-D Plus version.  The review rating is not explicitly stated, but the descriptions provide a comprehensive evaluation of each printer's features and performance.

**Star LC-10 Printer Review:**

The review highlights the Star LC-10 as a recently designed printer, suggesting the manufacturer learned from previous models.  It emphasizes the parallel interface (with an optional serial converter), the convenient front-panel switch, and the domed, smoked plastic top.  The review also notes the automatic tractor-feed paper handling and single-sheet auto-feed capabilities.  The printer's control panel is described as extensive, allowing for full control of NLQ print styles.  Paper parking is also controllable from the panel.

The review praises the printer's print quality, placing it as second only to the MT-81, but noting a wider range of fonts (though some font claims are described as ""wishful thinking"").  The review mentions four NLQ fonts, two of which are Orator fonts (serif and sans-serif, available in italics).  The review also discusses the printer's bitmap printing capabilities and even density.  The review concludes that the Star LC-10 is likely the most popular entry-level 9-pin printer due to its ease of use, good design, and sophisticated paper handling.

The page details reviews for two games:

**1. Tennis Cup:**

* **Rating:** 83% overall.

The game offers various options for gameplay, including different court types, game lengths, and player skill levels.  Players can choose their nationality and playing style, and save their progress.  The review highlights the game's longevity due to its options and the ability to play against a human or computer opponent.

**2. Dyter 07:**

66,"This page is a review of the video game ""The Colony,"" published in *Amiga Format* magazine.  The review is presented in a layout typical of a magazine article, with text and graphics interspersed.

**Review Rating:** The overall rating given to the game is 51%.

**Graphics and Sound:** The review notes that the graphics are similar to arcade tank classics, but the 3D graphics are sparse and the update is slow, making turning a corner a slow and disorienting procedure.  The sound effects are described as disappointing, consisting of only a few beeps and crunches, lacking the advanced sound effects expected of the Amiga platform.

**Gameplay and Lasting Interest:** The review criticizes the plot as long and involved, but the puzzles are overly simple, relying more on luck than judgment.  The battle scenes are described as excruciatingly difficult, with death occurring frequently after only a minute on the planet's surface.  The repetitive gameplay and frustrating nature of the game are highlighted.  The review also points out that the game's success depends on either involving gameplay or an incredible atmosphere, neither of which is present in The Colony.

**Story and Setting:** The game takes place in a 3D environment, combining solid polygon graphics for internal views and wireframe representations of the outside world.  The player begins in the control room of a damaged spaceship after a crash landing, and must repair systems, recover equipment, and navigate the environment to rescue the colonists and stop the spread of aliens.

**Specific Game Mechanics:** The review mentions the need to use any systems to gain access to further sections of the game, finding codes to use on the right equipment, and kitting oneself out with weapons.  The review also highlights the importance of repairing the damaged ship's reactor and using a code to access the surface through the airlock.

**Visual Elements:** The page includes several illustrations and screenshots of the game's environment, including the command center, the ship's interior, and exterior views.  These visuals show the pixelated graphics and the wireframe representations of the outside world.

**Overall Impression:** The review concludes that the game, while having a potentially interesting plot, falls short in its graphics, sound, and gameplay.  The repetitive and frustrating nature of the gameplay, combined with the simple puzzles and difficult battle scenes, are cited as major drawbacks.  The review suggests that the game might appeal to some players who enjoy the alien-inspired 3D adventure genre, but others may find it disappointing.

77,"This page is a review of the video game ""World Cup Soccer Italia '90"" for the Amiga computer system.

The review, written by Andy Smith, gives the game an overall rating of 74%.

**Graphics and Sound:** The review notes that the digitized speech and crowd noises are good, but the other sound effects are simple.  The graphics are described as ""great,"" especially from behind the goal, but the animation is somewhat jerky.

**Gameplay:** The game is described as having a ""lasting interest"" due to the challenging computer-controlled teams.  The two-player mode is highlighted as having more lasting interest.  The review points out a key difference in gameplay: the player must manually switch between players, rather than the game automatically switching to the player nearest the ball.  The perspective changes when an attacker is in the opposing team's box, offering a view from behind the player if attacking or behind the goalie if the other team is attacking.

**Judgment:** The reviewer calls it ""one of the better footy games around"" but notes that the automatic player switching feature is missing.  The game is compared favorably to ""Kick Off,"" but is considered the best of the World Cup-themed games reviewed so far.

**Lasting Interest:** The review states that the computer-controlled teams are challenging, keeping players engaged for a while.  The two-player mode is highlighted as having more lasting interest.

**Specifics:** The review mentions the game's use of the official World Cup license, the inclusion of England and other teams, and the use of a joystick.  It also describes the game's structure, including qualifying matches, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final.  The perspective is described as similar to other soccer games, viewed from above.

**Overall:** The review is positive, highlighting the game's challenging gameplay, good graphics (especially from behind the goal), and lasting interest, but also mentioning the jerky animation and the lack of automatic player switching.  The game is presented as a good option for fans of soccer games, especially those interested in the World Cup.  The price is listed as Â£19.99.  The review is part of a larger publication, ""Amiga Format,"" and is on page 77.

82,"This page is a review of the Checkmate Amiga A1500 kit, which allows users to convert an Amiga 500 into an Amiga 2000.  The review, written by Jason Holborn, is featured in *Amiga Format* magazine, as indicated by the magazine's title and page number (82).

The review begins with a headline and introductory paragraph highlighting the kit's ability to transform an Amiga 500 into a 2000 model using a screwdriver.

The review then delves into the pros and cons of the conversion.  It discusses the expansion potential of the Amiga 2000, contrasting it with the basic A500's limitations.  The review notes the A1500's improved design features, such as the front-facing disk drive slot, improved joystick and mouse port placement, and the inclusion of space for a second drive (like a 3.5-inch hard drive or Commodore's A590).  It also points out that the A500's original keyboard and PSU are now housed in their own casing, connected to the PSU via a cable.  The review also mentions the rugged construction of the A1500 case, highlighting its ability to withstand weight.

A section titled ""Construction"" details the ease of the conversion process, stating that it should take no longer than half an hour.  The steps involve opening the A500, removing the PSU, keyboard, and disk drive, and then installing them into the A1500 kit.  Crucially, the review emphasizes that no soldering is required.  It also mentions an optional animated tutorial and assistance available for those who are unsure about the conversion process.

The review also includes a section discussing the cost-benefit analysis of the conversion.  It notes that while the A1500 might be expensive if the goal is simply to improve the aesthetics of the A500, it's a worthwhile investment for those serious about expanding the capabilities of their Amiga 500.

The review concludes with a summary of the key factors to consider when purchasing the A1500 kit.  It emphasizes the kit's ability to expand the A500's capabilities and its rugged construction.

The page also includes several images:

*   A picture of the A1500 from various angles (top, back, and open interior).
*   A picture of the A1500's keyboard.

Finally, the page includes a price list and contact information for Checkmate Digital.  The review gives a rating (implicitly) by its overall positive tone and detailed description of the kit's benefits.

Crucially, it notes that an Amiga 2000 video slot can be added, but this requires soldering work by Checkmate.  The section highlights the OverRider box, which adds three more expansion slots, allowing for a wide range of combinations.  It emphasizes that while the A1500 and OverRider can handle PC Bridgeboard cards, the A1500 does *not* have PC slots, making the Bridgeboard cards effectively unusable.  The section concludes with a quote from Steve Jones of Checkmate, suggesting that if PC software is needed, a PC is a more cost-effective solution.

**Overall Impression:**

The page is clearly designed to showcase the A1500's flexibility and expansion options, while also highlighting the limitations compared to a standard PC.
