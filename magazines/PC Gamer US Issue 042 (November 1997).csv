"
152,"The image shows a promotional piece, likely for a video game or a similar product.  It's not a review page, but rather an evocative visual.

The background is a deep, rich purple, suggestive of a dramatic or fantasy setting.  The image is dominated by a figure, likely a female character, depicted in a stylized, almost painterly manner.  The figure is draped in dark, brownish-gold armor and clothing, with details that suggest intricate craftsmanship.  The armor and clothing are rendered with a texture that gives them a three-dimensional quality, even though the image is two-dimensional.

A prominent text overlay reads, ""There are 7 deadly sins in the world.""  The text is in a light, almost silvery-white color, contrasting sharply with the dark background.  The text is positioned above the figure, drawing the viewer's attention to the theme of sin and perhaps the game's narrative.

The overall impression is one of mystery, drama, and perhaps a touch of darkness.  The artistic style suggests a fantasy or role-playing game, and the text reinforces this theme.  There are no review ratings or other review elements present.  The image is purely promotional, aiming to create a sense of intrigue and anticipation for the product it represents.  The ""BY GAMERS"" text at the top right corner further suggests that the image is intended for a gaming audience.
"
153,"The page is a promotional image, likely from a video game advertisement or a magazine.  It features a stylized, almost surreal, image of a figure, possibly a character from the game.

The figure's form is depicted in a way that suggests a blend of organic and mechanical elements.  The colors are muted, with shades of beige, brown, and deep purple dominating the image.  The figure's limbs and body have a smooth, almost polished texture, contrasted with the more angular, sculpted details of the armor or equipment.

There's a text overlay that reads ""FOR GAMERS."" in a bold, capitalized font.  Below that, in a smaller, italicized font, is a phrase that reads ""...you are committing one of them right now.""  This text is positioned in a way that draws the viewer's eye to the figure and suggests an active, perhaps even urgent, aspect of the game.

The background includes a textured, parchment-like design with markings that could be symbols or diagrams.  The Interplay logo is also visible in the upper right corner.

The overall impression is one of a fantasy or science fiction game, emphasizing the player's role and the game's immersive nature. The image is designed to evoke a sense of excitement and intrigue about the game.  The text and imagery work together to create a compelling visual narrative about the game's experience.  There is no review rating visible on the page.
"
154,"The image is a promotional piece, likely for a book, album, or video game, judging by the stylized artwork and text.  It's not a review page.

The image is dominated by a large, stylized figure, seemingly a hybrid creature or personification.  The figure is depicted in a reclining or slumped position, with a mix of organic and mechanical elements.  Parts of the figure appear to be human-like, with limbs and torso, but other parts are clearly fantastical and possibly machine-like, with metallic or textured surfaces.  The figure's skin tones are a mix of pale, almost ethereal white and shades of orange-red.  The figure's head is adorned with a decorative, ornate headdress that is a mix of colors and textures.

The background is a deep, rich purple-blue, suggestive of a night sky or a mystical atmosphere.  There are hints of clouds or smoke in the background, and some small, stylized figures or structures are visible in the lower right quadrant.

A prominent text banner, in a bold, stylized font, reads ""Sinners beware, the purification is near..."".  This text is in a light color, contrasting with the dark background, and draws the viewer's attention to the image's theme.

There is also a smaller, more detailed image or mask-like object in the foreground, positioned to the left of the central figure.  This object is a mix of dark brown, orange, and green colors, with a textured surface and an unsettling, almost grotesque expression.  It appears to be a separate element within the overall composition.

The overall style of the image is surreal and evocative, with a strong emphasis on color, texture, and stylized forms.  The combination of dark colors, fantastical imagery, and the warning text creates a sense of mystery, dread, and perhaps even a hint of impending doom.  The image is not realistic, but rather a highly stylized and symbolic representation of a concept or theme.

While acknowledging some positive aspects, such as the variety of tracks and the ability to customize the racing experience, the reviewer criticizes the graphics as underwhelming, even with the 3Dfx accelerator support.  The game is also criticized for feeling out of place compared to other racing games of the time.  The reviewer notes that the game's handling and car distinctions are not very clear, but that an arcade mode helps new players.

219,"This page is a review of a PC game called XCar, published in PC Gamer magazine in November 1997.

The review, written by Todd Vaughn, gives the game a final verdict score of 68%.

**Review Details:**

The review begins by discussing the game's handling and graphics.  The reviewer notes a mixed experience with the handling, praising the balanced mix of track types but criticizing the unrealistic and subjective feeling of driving.  The graphics are also criticized, with the reviewer stating that while the cars themselves look good, the backgrounds and objects in the game appear jarring and poorly proportioned compared to the rest of the environment.  The in-car view is also mentioned as adding to the sense of scale issues.

The review then moves on to discuss the game's car editor.  The reviewer highlights the flexibility and ease of use of the editor as a strong point, suggesting it could be a benchmark for future racing simulations.  The editor allows for extensive customization of cars, including engines, fuel, tires, suspension, and paint jobs.  The editor interface is described as simple and user-friendly, with all options consolidated on a single screen.  However, the reviewer also points out that the process of building and tweaking a car can be monotonous and time-consuming, requiring patience and determination.

The review also mentions the game's tracks and the in-game video recording feature (VCR).  The VCR allows players to review their performance, including raw data on tire temperature, lateral G-forces, and speed.  This feature is praised as an invaluable tool for car tuning and improvement.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The reviewer concludes by summarizing the game's strengths and weaknesses.  XCar is praised for its customizable car editor, but criticized for its unrealistic handling, somewhat disappointing graphics, and challenging control scheme.  The review suggests that the game is best suited for players who enjoy tinkering with car setups and are willing to put in the time and effort to build their ideal car.  Casual gamers, however, might find the game's controls and default cars unappealing.

222,"This page is a promotional piece, likely a press release or advertisement, for a gaming network called HEAT.NET.  It's written in the style of a report or review by the CyberDiversion Institute.

The page highlights five key points about HEAT.NET, presented as bullet points labeled ""POINT #1,"" ""POINT #2,"" etc.  Each point details a specific aspect of the network and argues for its benefits in promoting ""world peace"" by diverting aggressive urges.

**Specific Points:**

* **POINT #1: Making Internet Gaming Easy:**  The CyberDiversion Institute claims HEAT.NET has the easiest start-up process compared to other networks.  It emphasizes the ease of access and the ability to play for free or through a subscription.

* **POINT #3: Making HEAT.NET Compatible With Nearly Every Multi-Player PC Game:**  This point emphasizes the wide range of games playable on the network, including popular titles like Quake, WarCraft II, and others.  It also mentions exclusive HEAT-only games and mods.

* **POINT #4: Rewarding Cyber-Aggression With Points And Prizes:**  This is the most unusual point.  The Institute argues that rewarding aggressive behavior within the game can actually reduce real-life aggression.  It suggests that HEAT.NET could even win a Nobel Peace Prize for this approach.

* **POINT #5: Creating Competition With Ladders And Events:**  This point focuses on the competitive aspect of the network, with automated events and prizes for top players.  It links this competition to achieving ""individual peace"" and ultimately ""world peace.""

**Review Rating:**  The page states that ratings are from 1 to 5 doves, with 5 doves being exceptional.  However, there's no explicit review rating given for HEAT.NET itself.  Instead, the text presents the Institute's assessment of the network's features.

**Comparison to Other Games:** The reviewer compares ""Starfleet Academy"" to other space combat games like TIE Fighter and Wing Commander IV, highlighting that those games offer a more satisfying experience in terms of action and gameplay.

**Target Audience:** The reviewer addresses the game's target audience, stating that fans of Star Trek who want a realistic command experience will likely be disappointed.

**Conclusion:** The reviewer concludes that while the game has some positive aspects, such as the multiplayer mode and the FMV story, the overall approach is uninspired and the gameplay is not challenging enough for budding Starfleet captains.  The reviewer ultimately feels that the game is a missed opportunity.

297,"This page is a review of the video game ""Jimmy Houston's Bass Tournament U.S.A. 97,"" published in PC Gamer magazine in November 1997.

The review gives the game a final verdict score of 55%.

**Game Overview:**

The game is a fishing simulation, placing players in the role of freshwater fishermen competing in a tournament.  The review highlights the game's attempt to capture the experience of fishing with fishing legend Jimmy Houston.

**Technical Aspects:**

The review criticizes the game's graphics as ""coarse and unrefined,"" with ""jagged edges and poorly matched colors.""  The animation of the player character is described as ""jerky and stiff,"" and the overall presentation is deemed ""rushed.""  The game's use of two CD-ROMs is noted, but the review suggests that much of the space is used for video footage of boats, rather than game content.

**Gameplay:**

The review points out that the game's graphics and gameplay don't effectively convey the experience of fishing.  The limited fishing areas and touchy casting interface are also criticized.  The tournament mode is described as challenging, but the practice mode is deemed less engaging.  The game's strategy is described as more about hitting the right spots in the right order with the right bait, rather than true skill.

**Review Details:**

The review, which appears in *PC Gamer* magazine (November 1997), gives a somewhat mixed assessment of the game.  The reviewer notes that the game attempts to revitalize the adventure genre, placing the action on a mythical island continent of Atlantis.  The game is described as having a first-person perspective, similar to *Zork: Nemesis* and *Myst*, allowing 360-degree movement.

**Rating/Recommendation:**

While the review doesn't explicitly state a numerical rating, it does include a ""We Recommend"" section, suggesting a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, view of the game.  The recommended system requirements include a Pentium 166 processor and a sound card.

**Technical Aspects:**

The reviewer praises the smooth and fluid movement, but criticizes the somewhat dated graphics, particularly the chunky character animations and unnatural lip movements.  The reviewer also notes that the 3D character animation is challenging to execute well on PCs at the time.

**Gameplay and Story:**

The reviewer mentions the game's use of dialogue choices, some of which have significant impact on the story, while others are less impactful.  The game's graphics are described as a key feature, but the reviewer notes that the side-scrolling animation style is not used, instead opting for a first-person perspective.

**Overall Impression:**

The review concludes with a mixed opinion.  While the game's attempt to innovate and offer a different adventure experience is acknowledged, the reviewer feels that the graphics quality is somewhat dated, and the character animation could be improved.  The reviewer also notes that the game's ambitious approach to character animation is commendable, but that it's a difficult task to execute well on PCs at the time.

**Review Summary:**

The review begins by noting the reviewer's disappointment with the game's graphics, particularly the way 3D characters are rendered on pre-rendered backgrounds, which makes them appear static.  The reviewer finds the story and puzzles to be uninspired, falling into predictable categories of dialog and key puzzles.  While the locations and characters have some personality, the dialog is described as laughably bad, but entertaining in a somewhat unintentional way.  The reviewer highlights that the puzzles, while sometimes challenging, feel disconnected from the overall narrative.  The game's inventory system is also criticized as being basic.

The reviewer also points out that many of the puzzles feel disconnected from the narrative.

* **Inventory and Story:** The review discusses the game's inventory system, noting that it's quite basic.  The reviewer also criticizes the story, stating that the puzzles feel arbitrarily placed and not integral to the narrative.

* **Overall Assessment:** The review concludes with a summary of the game's strengths and weaknesses.  The reviewer praises the variety of locations and characters but criticizes the repetitive puzzle design and the jerky 3D character movements.  The final verdict is that the game is a standard graphic adventure that may only appeal to those looking for a simple, albeit somewhat uninspired, experience.

The review highlights ""Imperialism"" as a strategy game that blends elements of conquest and economic management, falling somewhere between the grand scale of Civilization and the micro-management of games like Capitalism.  The game takes place in a fictional 19th-century world, emphasizing the importance of resource management, diplomacy, and military action.

**Key Features:**

* **Economic Depth:** The game's economy is a crucial aspect, requiring players to manage the flow of natural resources (timber, coal, cotton, and iron) to build defenses and expand their empire.  The review emphasizes the importance of maintaining a constant flow of resources to avoid economic stagnation and vulnerability to rivals.
* **Diplomacy:**  The game features a robust diplomatic system, allowing players to form alliances, offer subsidies, and engage in boycotts to influence other nations.  The goal is to expand the empire through voluntary alliances, but the option to use force is also present.
* **Military Action:**  While economic strength is crucial, military action is also necessary for expansion and defense.  The game allows for the production of armaments, including cavalry, but the review notes the potential dangers of selling arms to other nations.
* **Resource Extraction and Production:**  Players must extract resources like wood (from forests) and refine them into usable products.  The game's production system is detailed, requiring players to manage the extraction and production of various goods.
* **Specialized Units:**  The game introduces specialized units (like miners and foresters) that improve land productivity, unlike the more general settler units in other games.  These units require trained workers and resources like paper (made from wood).

* **Maps:** The maps are described as simplistic, with only seven major powers and little distinction between minor nations.
* **Bugs:** The reviewer mentions some bugs, including persistent crashes and video card bugs that garble text when scrolling.  The game also has an arbitrary ending with a council meeting that the reviewer feels is tacked on.

311,"This page is a review of the computer game ""Dragon Dice,"" published by Interplay Productions.  The review, appearing in *PC Gamer* magazine, is dated November 1997.

The review begins with a summary of the game's key details, including:

* **Category:** Strategy
* **Developer:** Interplay Productions
* **Publisher:** Interplay Productions, located at 16815 Von Karman Ave., Irvine, CA 92714, with a customer service number (800) 969-4263.
* **System Requirements:** Windows 95, double-speed CD-ROM drive, 486DX2/66, 8MB RAM, 47MB hard drive space, Super VGA, and a mouse.  The review also recommends a Pentium processor and a sound card.

The review then moves into a critical analysis of the game, stating that while the game successfully translates the tabletop dice game to the computer, it falls short in several key areas.

* **Review Rating (Implied):** The review is largely negative, highlighting significant shortcomings despite the game's initial promise.  The reviewer doesn't explicitly assign a numerical rating, but the overall tone and specific criticisms suggest a low score.

* **Review Content:** The review points out that the game's conversion from tabletop to computer is not as seamless as expected.  The reviewer notes:
    * **Complexity:** The game's rules and mechanics are described as confusing and requiring significant patience and practice to master, even for experienced tabletop players.
    * **Interface Issues:** The computer interface is criticized for not providing a clear overview of the battlefield.  The reviewer notes that the player's view is limited to a small portion of the playing field, making it difficult to assess the overall situation.  The graphics are also described as bland and uninspired.
    * **Conversion Issues:** The conversion from the tabletop game is not well-executed.  The reviewer notes that the computer version lacks the tactile and strategic elements of the original game, where the dice are physically rolled.  The computer version's automatic calculation of dice rolls, while helpful, doesn't replicate the strategic decision-making involved in the tabletop game.
    * **Gameplay:** The reviewer notes that while the game does a good job of calculating dice rolls, the game's interface and graphics are not as engaging as the tabletop version.  The reviewer also notes that the game can be tedious at times.

The review also includes screenshots and diagrams of the game's interface, including a Dragon Dice Strategy View, a Dragon Dice Campaign map, and a player order screen.  These visuals illustrate the game's design elements and the reviewer's points about the interface.

Finally, the review concludes with a brief summary of the game's strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing the game's shortcomings in its conversion from tabletop to computer.  The review also includes a final paragraph about the game's graphics and gameplay.

312,"This page is a review of a PC game called ""Dragon Dice Magic,"" published in PC Gamer magazine, November 1997.

The review, written by Michael Wolf, gives the game a 55% rating.

**Review Details:**

The review begins by describing the game's magic system, noting that it can be confusing at first but becomes easier with the manual.  It highlights the game's support for four-player multiplayer and three different solo play modes (standard, tournament, and campaign).  The review emphasizes the length of the campaigns, featuring sixteen scenarios for each of the four playable races (Coral Elf, Dwarf, Lava Elf, and Goblin).  The scenarios often involve winning territories or defeating enemy dragons.  However, the reviewer notes that these scenarios can become repetitive quickly, especially due to the computer's AI not posing a significant challenge.

The review also details the game's mechanics, including the use of dice for unit representation (six-sided dice for units, eight-sided dice for terrain).  It explains how the colors of the unit dice represent different races and classes (Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Cavalry, Missile, and Magic), and how the level of each class affects its attack and defense capabilities.  The review also explains how terrain dice determine the starting number of territories and the type of actions allowed in those territories.  The review also explains how dragon dice work when players cast magic spells, summoning dragons to attack enemy armies.

The review criticizes the game's animations, calling them ""hokey"" but useful for following the results of rolls.  It also points out the lack of a post-roll status screen, which makes tracking unit movements and damage difficult.

**Overall Impression:**

The review concludes that the game is a good learning tool for the tabletop game of Dragon Dice, but the tabletop version is a deeper strategy game.  The reviewer praises the game's ability to learn the game's mechanics without spending a lot of money, but criticizes the difficulty in tracking unit movements and the lack of detailed information presented in the game.

315,"The image is a vibrant, painterly illustration, likely from a comic book, video game, or fantasy novel.  It depicts a chaotic scene of intense combat.

Several figures are engaged in a dynamic struggle.  The style is highly stylized, with exaggerated features and bold colors.  The figures are not realistically proportioned, but rather convey a sense of power and action.

A large, monstrous, green creature, possibly a goblin or ogre, dominates the left side of the image.  It appears to be in the midst of an attack or defense.  Its armor or hide is textured and detailed, with spiky protrusions.

Another figure, clad in armor, is engaged in combat with the creature.  This figure is more humanoid, but also stylized.  The armor is a mix of light and dark colors, and the figure's posture suggests a defensive or offensive stance.

A third figure, draped in a flowing, purplish-gray robe, is wielding a long, light-colored blade.  This figure appears to be a powerful, possibly magical, opponent.  The figure's skeletal-like features and the way the robe flows suggest a supernatural or otherworldly quality.

A fourth figure, a woman, is also involved in the melee.  She is depicted in a dynamic pose, kicking or striking with a chain-like weapon.  Her attire is less armored and more revealing, suggesting a martial arts or warrior-like character.

The background is a swirling mix of vibrant colors, including reds, oranges, and purples.  These colors create a sense of intense energy and drama, further emphasizing the action of the scene.  The colors are not realistic, but rather contribute to the overall stylized and fantastical nature of the illustration.

The overall impression is one of a powerful, action-packed scene from a fantasy setting.  The style is reminiscent of comic book art or fantasy illustrations from the late 20th or early 21st century.  There are no review ratings or other textual elements visible in the image.

316,"This page is a review of the ""The Puzzle Collection"" video game, published by Microsoft.  The review, written by Lisa H. Renninger, appears in *PC Gamer* magazine, November 1997, on page 308.

The review gives the game a final verdict score of 52%.

**Game Overview:**

The review describes the game as a collection of brain-teasing and mind-numbing puzzles, developed by the creator of Tetris.  It's the first game from the Tetris developer since joining Microsoft.

**Game Features and Puzzles:**

The review details several specific puzzles within the collection:

* **Muddled Casino:**  Players must move playing cards off a grid to an exit without knocking others off.  Cards move in groups determined by symbols.
* **Finty Flush:**  A more enjoyable puzzle where different colored marbles fill a grid, and the player must fill the bottom grid with marbles of the same color.  The difficulty increases as the levels progress.
* **Color Collision:**  A puzzle where a line changes color as it zig-zags across the board.  The goal is to get the line to touch sunshines of the same color.
* **Fringer:**  Players untangle ropes in alternating directions as a bar comes down and tangles them.  The review notes this puzzle as somewhat boring.
* **Rat Poker:**  Similar to Fringer, but with colored rats that need to be combined into winning poker hands.
* **Jewel Chase:**  A relatively easy puzzle where players grab jewels and coins before a computer-controlled creature.
* **Spring Weekend:**  Players rotate gardening icons on a board to match the computer design.
* **Lineup:**  A puzzle with odd-shaped five-block pieces (sports balls) that need to be lined up on a grid.
* **Charmer:**  Players use flutes to charm snakes out of pots.

**Review Summary:**

The review praises the variety of puzzles in the collection, but criticizes the uneven quality.  While some puzzles are engaging and fun, others are considered boring or too elementary.  The wide range of difficulty levels may turn off some players.  The review concludes that while the collection is a decent package for puzzle fans, none of the puzzles match the quality of Tetris.  The reviewer notes that the variety is commendable, but the collection is ultimately too uneven to enjoy all the puzzles.  The price point ($35 MSRP) is also mentioned.

**Technical Specifications:**

The page also includes the game's required specifications, including operating system (Windows 95), CD-ROM drive, RAM requirements, and hard drive space.

320,"This page is a review of the video game ""Pacific General,"" published in PC Gamer in November 1997.

**Review Rating:** The review is highly critical, describing the game as a ""loud, wooden 'Clunk!'"" rather than a successful entry in the Five Star series.  While the reviewer acknowledges some aspects of the game, the overall tone is negative.

**Review Details:**

The review begins by listing the game's requirements (Windows 95, Quad-speed CD-ROM drive, Pentium 90, 16MB RAM, 1 MG Super VGA) and recommended specifications (Pentium 133, Supported Sound Card, 32 MB RAM).

The review then delves into a detailed critique of the game, highlighting several key issues:

* **Design Conflicts:** The reviewer notes a conflict between realism and fun in the game's design, preferring the more enjoyable aspects of previous games in the series.
* **Gameplay Issues:** The game's gameplay is described as ""murky and unbalanced,"" frustrating veteran players.  The reviewer states that the game's core concepts are unclear and confusing.
* **Graphics and Sound:** The graphics are criticized as having little improvement over previous games, with pale gray symbols and a distracting 1940s swing soundtrack.
* **Interface Issues:** The interface is a significant point of contention. The reviewer finds the new icons confusing and unhelpful, and the placement of controls on the screen is described as clumsy and obstructive.  The loss of 25% of the screen view when using the spacebar to keep menus visible is also noted as a major flaw.
* **Naval Combat:** While the game features a greatly expanded naval element, the reviewer finds the implementation of carrier operations to be poorly executed.
* **Overall Impression:** The reviewer concludes that the game was rushed into production and lacks the polish and care of previous entries in the series.  The reviewer expresses disappointment in the game's quality, comparing it unfavorably to other SSI products like ""Carrier Strike.""

**Additional Information:**

* **Campaign Mode:** The review mentions a Japanese invasion scenario in the campaign mode, but doesn't elaborate on its quality.
* **Battle Generator:** The reviewer describes the main Battle Generator screen as ""a complicated mess and about as user-friendly as a junkyard dog,"" highlighting the complexity and unintuitive nature of the interface.
* **Stand-Alone Battles:** While the stand-alone battles are described as mostly fun and solid, the review doesn't provide specific examples.
* **Comparison to Panzer General:** The review draws comparisons between Pacific General and its predecessor, Panzer General, highlighting the latter's strengths and the former's shortcomings.

The review is clearly negative, expressing significant dissatisfaction with the game's design, implementation, and overall user experience.
"
321,"This page is a PC Gamer review of the video game ""Pacific General.""  The review, written by William R. Trotter, gives the game a 48% rating, indicating a significant level of dissatisfaction.

The review is structured into several sections, discussing different aspects of the game:

**Gameplay and Carrier Battles:** The reviewer criticizes the carrier battle mechanics as unrealistic and frustrating.  Players cannot launch multiple air strikes in a single turn against a single target, and planes cannot move after dropping bombs.  This makes the historically accurate method of sinking carriers impossible in the game.  The reviewer also notes that the Allied campaign begins with the Battle of Midway, which is a difficult and confusing battle to win.  The arbitrary victory conditions and lack of clear instructions are also highlighted as major problems.

**Battle Generator:** The battle generator is described as overly complicated and poorly explained in the manual.  The reviewer states that even experienced wargamers will waste significant time trying to understand the generator's mechanics.  The inability to save at the end of a campaign battle is also a major complaint.

**Campaign Design:** The reviewer criticizes the Allied campaign's illogical starting point and the arbitrary nature of the victory conditions.  The game's design is described as frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying.

**Technical Issues:** The reviewer points out several technical issues, including the inability to import maps or unit rosters from other games in the series, the need for manual input for scenario data, and the cumbersome unit deployment system.  The reviewer also notes that the game's battle generator is poorly implemented and that the game's interface has undergone significant and unhelpful changes.

**Overall Impression:** The review concludes that ""Pacific General"" is a significant disappointment, with its frustrating gameplay, confusing mechanics, and poor design choices outweighing any redeeming qualities.  The reviewer highlights the stand-alone scenarios as the only positive aspect of the game, but even these are not enough to save the game from a very low rating.
"
322,"This page is promotional material, likely from a video game, for a game called ""Galapagos.""  It's a detailed description of the game's premise and a character, Mendel.

The text describes a technologically advanced, unstable world called Galapagos.  It's populated by mechanized soldiers and is depicted as a place of conquest and resource draining.  The creators of Galapagos are driven by genius and greed, using pillaged resources to build pre-programmed war machines.

The central character, Mendel, is described as a unique synthetic organism.  He's different from the other war machines because he has the ability to learn and adapt through trial and error.  He's a prototype for a new generation of autonomous war machines, and if his engineering is replicated, Galapagos would become unstoppable.

However, Mendel is currently trapped in a laboratory, awaiting torturous experiments.  The player can help him escape, but they can't control his actions.  If Mendel doesn't escape, Galapagos will prosper and its army will ravage the galaxy.

327,"The image is a cover art for a music album, likely a metal album, judging by the style.  The overall color palette is dark and ominous, dominated by shades of deep red, brown, and black.

The central figure is a skeletal-like warrior, clad in dark, ornate armor.  The figure has large, pronounced horns, and the armor appears to be made of metal, with intricate details.  The figure holds a large sword, and the overall impression is one of power and aggression.

Surrounding the central figure are numerous skulls, which are a prominent feature of the artwork.  The skulls are depicted in varying states of decay and are arranged in a dense cluster, creating a sense of a macabre or hellish atmosphere.

343,"This page is a review of the SSI MTS 100 speakers, published in PC Gamer in November 1997.

The review begins with product specifications:

* **Company:** SSI Products
* **Phone:** (800) 845-4774 (for ordering)
* **Price:** $179.95

The review then describes the speaker system, highlighting its design as an all-in-one surround sound solution.  It includes a subwoofer, Dolby Pro Logic Surround decoder, and five speakers.  The electronics are all integrated into the subwoofer.  The review notes the system's compact size and relatively low price point.  It also points out the clear labeling of the various 1/8"" jacks on the subwoofer, which is a helpful feature for users connecting multiple components.

The review also discusses the placement of the speakers and subwoofer, noting that the subwoofer's placement under the desk is inconvenient, and that all the controls are located on the subwoofer unit.  The reviewer also notes the need to find suitable locations for the speakers, especially the rear speakers, which may require placement behind or beside the user.

The review then delves into the sound quality.  While the system scores high on the gadget scale, it falls short in basic sound quality.  The reviewer notes that the system has a master volume knob and a test-tone generator for adjusting speaker levels.  However, the system's amplifiers are relatively weak, particularly the rear speakers, which are rated at only 4 watts each.  The reviewer criticizes the midrange frequencies as muddy and indistinct, and the highs as thready and washed-out.  The review concludes that the sound quality is not significantly better than the speakers typically included with a PC.

The review also mentions the Dolby Surround decoder, noting that it does produce a genuine surround effect, but the overall sound quality is not exceptional.  The reviewer suggests that the system's value depends on the user's priorities: if the surround effect is paramount, it might be a decent purchase; otherwise, better speaker systems are available in the same price range.

Finally, the review concludes with a ""PC Gamer Final Verdict"" section, summarizing the pros and cons:

* **Highs:** Easy setup, lots of control over sound level and balance, genuine Dolby Surround.
* **Lows:** Under-powered, below-average sound quality, not many PC games support Dolby Surround.
* **Bottom Line:** A decent integrated surround sound solution, but don't expect great sound quality.

The review is dated November 1997 and is part of a larger ""Hard Stuff"" section in the magazine.

**VRex VR Surfer Review:**

* **Rating:** The review concludes with a negative final verdict, highlighting significant drawbacks.
* **Description:** The VRex VR Surfer is a wireless 3D headset that uses shutter glasses to create a 3D viewing experience.  The review praises the initial 3D experience, particularly with older games like Descent II.
* **Pros:**  The visual effects are described as ""pretty cool.""  It supports online 3D image viewing.
* **Cons:**  The review emphasizes the significant drawback of severe eye strain and splitting headaches after only 15 minutes of use.  The glasses are described as uncomfortable, and the technology is not well-suited for newer, more demanding games.  The lack of support for newer games is also noted.
* **Technical Details:** The headset uses LCD shutters to rapidly alternate images for each eye, creating the 3D effect.  It's wireless, but the review notes that the technology is not yet mature enough to support the full experience.
* **Overall:** The review concludes that while the initial 3D experience is enjoyable, the significant discomfort and limitations make it a poor overall choice.

**Suncom FX1000 Joystick Review:**

* **Rating:** The review concludes with a positive, but slightly qualified, final verdict.
* **Description:** The Suncom FX1000 is a budget-friendly, two-button joystick.  It's simple, lacking advanced features.
* **Pros:**  The joystick is described as ""cheap, comfortable,"" and a ""not a bad little stick.""  It's a functional option for gamers on a tight budget.  It's easy to use with DOS games and works well with Windows 95.
* **Cons:**  The review notes that the joystick is ""flimsy, imprecise, and has no extras.""  It's not the most responsive or precise joystick in the price range.
* **Technical Details:** The joystick is a basic analog 2-button design.  It's compatible with a wide range of games, including DOS and Windows 95 titles.
* **Overall:** The review concludes that the FX1000 is a decent option for budget-minded gamers, but more expensive options offer better performance.  It's a good choice if you're looking for a basic joystick without spending a lot of money.

353,"This page is a review of the Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro joystick, published in PC Gamer in November 1997.

The review is presented in a standard magazine layout, with a large headline highlighting the product.  Subheadings and bullet points are used to organize the information.

**Product Overview:**

The review begins by describing the Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro as a joystick that adds a significant level of realism to gaming.  It emphasizes the force feedback technology, explaining how internal motors create physical responses in the joystick based on in-game actions (e.g., driving, shooting, etc.).  The review notes the joystick's size and weight, mentioning the presence of motors, gears, a cooling fan, and optical position sensors.  It contrasts the use of electric eyes (optical sensors) with potentiometers, highlighting the improved calibration and consistency of the force feedback.

**Features and Design:**

The review details the joystick's features, including the digital design, throttle, hat switch, twist axis, and programmable options through Microsoft's software.  It also discusses the button layout, noting the addition of a ""shift"" button that activates an optional secondary function for some buttons.  The review specifically points out the new, more comfortable grip design compared to previous SideWinder models.  The placement of the trigger and thumb buttons is praised for their intuitive positioning.

**Performance and Comparison:**

The review compares the Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro to the CH Products Force FX, highlighting the improvements in force feedback quality and responsiveness.  It notes that the new joystick provides a more solid and less prone-to-vibration force feedback experience.  The review also discusses the optical sensors that detect hand presence, preventing unwanted vibrations when the user isn't holding the joystick.  The review also mentions the ""virtual tension"" mode, which allows the joystick to function as a standard joystick if the game doesn't support force feedback.

**Game Compatibility and Experience:**

The review discusses the compatibility of the joystick with various games, including MDK: Mission Laguna Beach, Shadows of the Empire: The Battle of Hoth, and Interstate '76.  It notes that the force feedback works well in vehicle-control games but can be less effective in games where the force feedback is less relevant to the player's actions.  The review also acknowledges that the force feedback can be a distraction in some games, potentially hindering gameplay if the player is more focused on the realism than the gameplay itself.

**Final Verdict and Conclusion:**

The review concludes with a ""Final Verdict"" section, summarizing the pros and cons of the joystick.  The pros include the comfortable grip, intuitive programming, and solid force feedback.  The cons include the high price and the large size of the base.  The review concludes with a ""Bottom Line"" that summarizes the joystick as an excellent force feedback joystick with many positive features.  The review is rated as a ""PC Gamer Editors' Choice.""

385,"This page is an article from PC Gamer magazine, November 1997, titled ""Vox Populi: The Wargamers Speak Out!"".  It's a feature focusing on reader feedback and opinions regarding wargames, specifically the perceived lack of innovation and variety in the genre.

The article begins with a column by William R. Trotter, who introduces the topic by highlighting a large volume of reader mail regarding the feeling of alienation and anger among wargamers towards the gaming industry.  He notes that many feel the industry is prioritizing quantity over quality, focusing on bigger numbers and popular battles rather than exploring less-common or historically nuanced scenarios.

The article then features a response from Dan Cyr, a middle-aged wargamer with 30 years of experience.  Cyr criticizes the lack of new historical scenarios in wargames, arguing that companies are failing to provide fresh content and are instead focusing on rehashing existing battles with minor variations. He specifically mentions the lack of a Civil War naval game, and the preference for replaying familiar battles over exploring new ones.  He also touches on the importance of incorporating realistic intelligence gathering and logistics into wargames.

The article also includes a response from Cyr, who elaborates on the point of diminishing returns in wargaming.  He argues that the act of tinkering with history, while enjoyable, can become the game itself rather than the goal of winning or losing.

The article also includes a response from another reader, who suggests that the ""Panthers in the Shadows"" game could serve as a model for larger game companies, implying that smaller, more niche games can be successful and inspire larger studios.

Overall, the article presents a critical perspective on the wargaming industry, highlighting the concerns of wargamers about the lack of innovation, historical depth, and player engagement in the genre.

* **Avoiding Multiple Opponents:**  Advising players to avoid war with multiple computer opponents in the early game, as it's difficult to manage.
