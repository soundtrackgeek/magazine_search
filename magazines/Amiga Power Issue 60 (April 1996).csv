The review gives the game a **Table Rating of 7**.  The reviewer begins by describing the game's theme, which is presented as a somewhat unusual and perhaps overly Americanized take on a galactic espionage theme, featuring a manga-style character.

* **Loading Issues:** The reviewer points out the cumbersome loading process, requiring multiple disks.
* **Unnecessary Complexity:** The reviewer suggests that the game's complexity is not justified by its quality.

"
29,"This page is a game review for ""Watchtower,"" published in Amiga Power in April 1996.  The review, written by Cam Winstanley, gives the game a 41% rating.

The review is presented in a multi-panel format, with various sections discussing different aspects of the game.

**Overall Impression:** The reviewer expresses significant disappointment with ""Watchtower,"" describing it as a ""stillborn"" release that fails to offer any significant improvements over existing Amiga games.  The review highlights numerous flaws, including poor control, repetitive gameplay, and a frustrating experience.

**Control:** The reviewer criticizes the control scheme as ""terrible,"" noting that players can only fire in the direction they're moving.  This, combined with a ""lock-off"" scrolling mechanic that restricts movement, makes the gameplay feel clunky and frustrating.  The limited lives (only two) further exacerbates the difficulty.

**Graphics:** The graphics are described as ""nob"" and ""wonky,"" with the characters and vehicles depicted as simple, blocky figures.  The reviewer notes that while the explosions are visually appealing, the overall aesthetic is not impressive.

**Scrolling:** The scrolling mechanic is a major point of criticism.  The reviewer explains that the game's scrolling is triggered at specific points in the level, and if the player hasn't eliminated all enemies, some will reappear off-screen, continuing to attack.  This makes the gameplay feel disjointed and frustrating.

**Variety:** The reviewer finds the game lacking in variety, with similar enemies and environments throughout the six levels.  The three distinct locations are not enough to compensate for the repetitive gameplay.

**Lives:** The limited two lives and the inability to increase them are a significant flaw, as the reviewer notes that this makes the game more about avoiding death than engaging in strategic gameplay.

**Bottom Line:** The review concludes that ""Watchtower"" seems to have fallen through a ""warphole in the space/time continuum"" from a time before more refined games.  The reviewer feels that after playing several games, the experience becomes frustrating and the joystick feels heavy due to the game's shortcomings.

**Other Sections:** The page also includes screenshots of the game, showcasing the pixelated graphics and the gameplay environment.  There are also smaller sections discussing the game's ""power-ups,"" ""weapons,"" and ""control"" in more detail.  The review also mentions the game's similarities to ""Stardust"" (AP33, 89%), but notes that the only link between the two is the visual effect of explosions.
