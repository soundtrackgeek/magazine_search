Both reviewers ultimately conclude that the game is not particularly engaging or fun for the average gamer, but more suitable for tank enthusiasts.

He finds the gameplay repetitive and frustrating, citing issues with the controls, the lack of action replays, and the erratic collision detection.  He also notes that the game's sound is underwhelming.  He concludes that the game, while visually appealing, lacks the engaging gameplay that he expects from a good game.

He describes the gameplay as repetitive, noting that the player quickly gets bored with the missions and starts just driving around and shooting at targets.
