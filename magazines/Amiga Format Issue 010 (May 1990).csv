85,"This page is an article from a magazine called ""Games Programming"" (part 4), detailing the programming behind the alien movement in the game ""Menace"".  The author, Dave Jones, is described as the ""ace coder"" behind the game, and the article is a breakdown of the code's logic.

The article focuses on the alien movement routines, specifically how the aliens are positioned, animated, and controlled on-screen.  It's a technical deep-dive into the game's programming, not a general review of the game itself.

**Key Sections and Details:**

* **Introduction:** The article begins by stating that the current installment details the alien movement and control routines of the game ""Menace"".  The author explains that the source code will be covered in the next installment.
* **Movement Logic:** The article explains the need for a data structure to control alien movement.  It outlines the basic data needed to describe an alien:
    * Alien number
    * X-coordinate
    * Y-coordinate
    * Alien speed
* **Alien Movement Instructions:** The article provides examples of how to program the aliens to move from one point to another on the screen.  It shows how the code uses memory addresses to control the aliens' positions and speeds.  The example code uses `dc.w` and `dc.b` instructions, which are likely assembly language instructions for the Amiga computer.
* **Animation:** The article explains the need to include animation data in the alien structure.  It details how the animation number is separate from the alien number, making it easier to change the animation without affecting the alien's position.  It also explains how the maximum number of animations is stored separately.
* **Data Structures:** The article describes the memory layout and structure used to store the data for each alien, including the current animation frame and the total number of animations available.
* **Code Examples:** The article provides specific code examples (using assembly language) to illustrate how the alien movement and animation are controlled.  These examples show how the code manipulates memory locations to change the aliens' positions and animation states.

**Overall:** The article is highly technical and geared towards programmers interested in understanding the inner workings of game development.  It's not a review of the game's quality or enjoyment, but rather a detailed explanation of the programming techniques used to create the alien behavior.  There's no review rating mentioned.

This section explains how to animate an alien.  It describes the `Anim.Num` variable, which increments to cycle through different animation frames.  The text explains the concept of a ""wrap"" animation, where the animation sequence loops back to the beginning, and an ""updown"" animation, where the sequence counts up to a maximum and then back down.  It also introduces the `Anim_Delay` variable, which controls the speed of the animation.  The section includes a diagram showing different animation frames.

**Section 2: Reason for Living is Dying**

This section discusses the programming logic behind the alien's behavior.  It explains why aliens don't die immediately after being hit, introducing a `Hits_Num` variable to control how many hits an alien can take before being destroyed.  It also mentions the concept of indestructible aliens, which are not destroyed by player fire.

**Section 3: Figure Two - Four Sprites Make One Large Sprite**

This section describes how multiple sprites (graphical elements) can be combined to create a larger, more complex sprite.  The diagram shows how the sprites are arranged.

**Section 4: Back to Motion**

This section focuses on the movement of the aliens.  It explains the limitations of using `GOTO` commands to define movement paths, and introduces a more flexible method using relative coordinates.  The text explains how relative coordinates (offsets) are added to the current position to create movement patterns, such as circles.  It also introduces the concept of ""absolute mode"" and ""relative mode"" for movement, allowing the game to switch between these modes.  The section includes example code snippets (`dc.w`) demonstrating how to use relative coordinates to create movement patterns.

**Overall:**

The document is a detailed explanation of the programming techniques used to create the alien behavior in the game.  It provides insights into the design choices made by the programmer, such as the use of animation delays, the implementation of different animation types, and the use of relative coordinates for movement.

129,"This page is a review of two music sequencing software packages for the Amiga computer, ""Copyist"" and ""KCS v3.0,"" from Dr. T.  The review, written by Jon Bates, appears in *Amiga Format* magazine, issue 129.

The review begins with an introductory paragraph that questions the need for yet another sequencing package, noting that the market for such software is not shrinking.  It then highlights the increasing popularity of music sequencing software in professional studios and home use.  The review specifically mentions that the bundled sequencing package KCS v3.0 is part of a larger educational bundle from Commodore UK.

The review then dives into a detailed description of KCS v3.0.  It states that KCS v3.0 has three operational pages and several host routines/programs that can interact and control certain areas.  The three main operation modes are Track, Song, and Open.  The review emphasizes the main Track page, which displays 48 tracks, and the three sections of the screen below it: Real-time quantize, MIDI re-channeling, track control, and copy, erase, over-record, and jump to cue points.  The review also details the ""tape transport"" controls (forward, rewind, play, pause, stop, record), metronome, and location counter.  The review also notes the status of each track (solo or muted).

The review also discusses the ability of the programs to work together.  It mentions Dr. T's Multi Program Environment, which allows up to 19 programs to interact.  The review notes that the programs require a significant amount of RAM (at least 2MB) to run smoothly, and that additional RAM disk storage might be necessary for temporary files.

The review also includes screenshots of the software's interface.  The screenshots show the various menus, controls, and track information.  The review highlights the ""Track Screen"" with 48 tracks and ""handy icon controls.""  It also shows the ""Track Editing"" section, where events are listed on the left side of the screen, and commands are on the right.

The review also discusses the tempo options, which range from 10 to 999 beats per minute, and the ability to use MIDI filters for controllers and aftertouch.

The review concludes with a summary of the software's features and capabilities.  The review rating is not explicitly stated, but the overall tone of the review suggests a positive assessment of the software's functionality and features.

153,"This page is an article from a magazine, likely *Amiga Format*, reviewing the GeniScan 4000 hand-held scanner.  The article is written by Tim Smith.

**Headline:** DELIVERED BY HAND - TIM SMITH gets to grips with the GeniScan 4000 hand-held scanner from Datel.

**Review Content:**

The review begins by highlighting the scanner's ease of use, mentioning its 13-amp power socket, parallel port, and flat scanning surface.  It notes the software's ability to manipulate images, but doesn't delve into specific software features.  The reviewer emphasizes the scanner's modest logic chips housed in a small plastic case.  A key point is that the scanner is monochrome, not capable of handling the Amiga's 4096 colors.  The reviewer notes that color scanning would be significantly more expensive.

The article then describes the scanner's output: grey scales rather than flat monochrome, with 16 levels of gradation or a simple two-tone option.  Both formats can be saved in IFF or RAW.  The grey scale output is suitable for transferring images to other software like desktop publishing programs.

**Sections:**

* **Head:** This section describes the scanning process, focusing on the scanning head's resemblance to a 1970s spaceship.  It highlights the thumbwheel brightness control and its effect on the image displayed on screen, and how it affects the software's interpretation of light and dark.  The reviewer also mentions a resolution switch that works in tandem with the software.

* **ABOVE: The GeniScan 4000:**  A visual depiction of the scanner, emphasizing its resemblance to a 1970s spaceship.

* **ABOVE LEFT: Defining the size of the scan:**  A section likely describing the process of setting the scan area.

* **Options:** The review details the options available for image scanning.  There are three Photo options, which are different grey scale settings, dependent on the quality of the original image.  The reviewer explains that the Photo options are for picking out details in images.  There's also a Letter option, which produces full monochrome images without scaling, suitable for line drawings, cartoons, or photographs.

**Overall Impression:**

The review provides a detailed overview of the GeniScan 4000 scanner's features, ease of use, and limitations.  It emphasizes the scanner's monochrome capabilities and the cost-effectiveness compared to color scanners.  The review also highlights the software's role in image manipulation and the different output options available.  The review rating isn't explicitly stated, but the overall tone suggests a positive, if not enthusiastic, assessment of the scanner's capabilities.
"

**Sections:**

* **Softly Software:** This section describes the user-friendly interface of the scanner's software.  It emphasizes the software's ability to make image manipulation tasks like cutting, copying, pasting, and mixing images straightforward.  It also mentions the software's ability to save images directly to disk or use built-in editing tools.

* **Old Buffer:** This section details the scanner's buffer capabilities, allowing users to scan multiple pages or screens at once.  It explains how the buffer stores scanned images, enabling efficient scanning of multiple pages.

* **Fiddle About:** This section provides practical tips and advice for achieving optimal scanning results.  It cautions against using glossy surfaces, recommending matte images instead, and emphasizes the importance of a flat scanning surface for clear results.  It also touches on the scanner's speed and ease of use.

* **Conclusion:** This section summarizes the review's findings.  It praises the scanner's ease of use and capability to produce good results, but also notes that the manual could have included more practical examples and that the printed output might not perfectly match the on-screen image.  It also mentions the software's compression capabilities and lack of fine-tuning options.

* **Technical Specifications:** The page includes the price and contact information for the scanner's manufacturer, Datel.

**Overall Impression:** The review presents a balanced assessment of the Geni-Scan 4000.  It highlights the scanner's strengths, such as its ease of use and ability to handle multiple pages, but also points out areas for improvement, such as the manual's clarity and the lack of a print function.  The review's tone suggests that the scanner is a functional tool for Amiga users, but not necessarily a revolutionary one.
