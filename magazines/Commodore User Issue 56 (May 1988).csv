The cover is dated May 1988 and features a vibrant, somewhat stylized illustration of a futuristic, possibly military, figure.  The figure is central to the image and is depicted in a dynamic pose, suggesting action or combat.  The background is a mix of bold colors, including reds, yellows, and blues, creating a visually striking and energetic design.

The cover prominently features the title ""COMMODORE USER"" in large, bold, capital letters.  Below this, the headline ""WE GRAB BIONIC COMMANDOS"" is displayed in a smaller, but still noticeable, font.  This suggests a focus on a particular game featured in the magazine.

Further down the cover, there's a section titled ""HOT REVIEWS"" listing several games: GUTZ, CYBERNOID, KARNOV, ALIEN SYNDROME, IMPOSSIBLE MISSION II, ARCADES: NEMESIS III, and VULCAN VENTURE.  This indicates that the magazine includes reviews of these games.

The cover also highlights ""PIRACY ON TRIAL"" in a large, bold font.  This suggests a discussion or article about the topic of software piracy.

The cover also includes pricing information in different currencies (350 pta, HFL 5.90, DM 5.50) and a statement that it's ""No. 1 for Amiga Games"" and a price of £1.10.

Finally, the bottom section of the cover advertises ""PLAY TO WIN: MAGNETRON, SAMURAI WARRIOR, INCREDIBLE IO MAP"" and ""ANOTHER AMAZING AMIGA PULL-OUT.""  This suggests that the magazine includes game play tips, strategy guides, or potentially a special section dedicated to Amiga games.  The ""pull-out"" aspect implies a detachable section with additional content.  The date ""88"" is also visible, further confirming the publication date.

The text describes the game's plot: three government officials have been captured by a ""Dream Demon,"" who is using their captured information to formulate evil plans.  The player, as the ""Dream Warrior,"" must overcome various enemies, including a ""Two Headed Monster"" and ""Demi-Demons,"" to defeat the Dream Demon and save the world.

The text highlights the game's combination of strategy and fast-paced action, suggesting a challenging gameplay experience.  The phrase ""Because your wildest dreams will become a NIGHTMARE"" adds a sense of suspense and danger.

3,"The page is an advertisement for a video game, likely from a vintage computer magazine or catalog.  The dominant visual is a vibrant, stylized illustration of two large, alien-like creatures, predominantly yellow and green with pink accents.  The creatures have large, expressive eyes, sharp teeth, and spiky horns.  The creatures' forms are exaggerated and almost cartoonish, but with a futuristic, sci-fi aesthetic.

Interspersed within the illustration are smaller, inset images of game screen captures.  One shows a pixelated, side-scrolling game scene, featuring a character navigating a futuristic, blue-toned environment.  The character is small and appears to be a soldier or similar figure.  The background includes elements like a lift, and numbers, suggesting a game with a level or score system.  Another inset image shows a different, more space-themed scene with a creature.

Below the main illustration, there's a table listing the pricing for the game on different computer systems.  The table clearly shows the different versions of the game (CBM 64/128, Spectrum, Amstrad, IBM PC) and the corresponding tape and disk prices.  The prices are in British pounds (£).

Finally, at the bottom of the page, there's contact information for the company, U.S. Gold Ltd., including their address, phone number, and a logo.  The logo includes the words ""U.S. Gold"" in a stylized, gold-colored font, with a registered trademark symbol.

37,"This page is a review of the video game ""Microleague Wrestling,"" published by Microprose.

**Game Overview:**

The review describes the game as having a unique approach to wrestling game graphics. Instead of the typical sprite-based graphics, the game uses digitized photos of real wrestlers.  The reviewer notes this as a significant difference, but also points out that the lack of sprite-based grappling makes the game feel less engaging.  The game is for the 64/128 Microprose system and costs £19.95 for the disk only.

**Gameplay Details:**

The review highlights the game's moves, noting that some complex moves, like the elbow drop, are shown in a series of five shots.  Simpler moves, like punches and stomps, are shown as alternating images.  The game involves choosing a move, and the computer determines the outcome, displaying the result with digitized pictures.  The game features a power meter and damage display for each wrestler, and the moves can lead to a pin or victory.  Matches can last 10, 20, or even 60 minutes (for a ""Grudge Match"").  The game also includes commentary from Vince McMahon, shown as a digitized face on the screen.

**Characters and Story:**

The review introduces the main wrestlers: Hulk Hogan, Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage, and Paul ""Mr. Wonderful"" Orndorff.  The game allows the player to choose one of these wrestlers to compete against the computer or a friend.  Before the match, the player sees a sequence of digitized photos of the wrestlers being interviewed by Mean Gene Okerlund.

**Review Rating and Conclusion:**

The game receives a **4 out of 10** rating.  The reviewer expresses mixed feelings. While the digitized pictures are well-displayed, the gameplay is limited to choosing moves from a menu.  The reviewer finds the sequences of moves repetitive and the commentary tedious after a while.  The lack of real challenge and the repetitive nature of the gameplay lead to a quick loss of interest.
