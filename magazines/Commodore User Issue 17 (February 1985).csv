44,"This page is from a Commodore User magazine, likely an article or tutorial.  The article is titled ""Operation Salvage: How to recover a corrupted or NEWed program"" by Frank Randall.

The article is a step-by-step guide for recovering corrupted or accidentally overwritten programs on Commodore 64 and VIC-20 computers.  The author emphasizes that this method works for both systems.

The article begins with an introduction explaining the frustration of losing programs and the common causes of corruption.  It then presents a detailed procedure in a numbered list format, explaining each step with specific BASIC commands.

**Step-by-Step Procedure:**

* **Step 1:**  The user types three lines of BASIC code: `POKE 45, 200: POKE 46, PEEK(56)-1: CLR`.  This initializes the program.
* **Step 2:** The user types another line of BASIC code: `A = PEEK(43) + PEEK(44)*256`. This calculates a value.
* **Step 3:** The user types a loop: `FOR J = 1 TO 10000: PRINT PEEK(A + 2) + PEEK(A + 3)*256; A: A = PEEK(A) + PEEK(A + 1)*256: NEXT`. This part of the code iterates through memory locations, printing values.
* **Step 4:** The user types `A` and the calculated value `x` from a previous step.
* **Step 5:** The user types `POKE 45, A - (INT(A/256)*256): POKE 46, A/256: CLR`. This final step completes the recovery process.

**Explanation of How It Works:**

The article explains that programs are stored in memory with pointers that link lines.  Each line has a two-byte line number (low byte and high byte).  The method described in the article manipulates these pointers to recover the program.  The article details how the BASIC commands work to access and modify these memory locations.

**Example Display:**

The article includes a sample display showing line numbers and addresses.  It highlights the importance of identifying a line number that is out of sequence and followed by a zero address.

**Overall:**

The article provides a technical solution to a common problem for Commodore users.  It's a detailed, step-by-step guide, but requires a good understanding of BASIC programming and memory manipulation. The article is aimed at experienced users who are comfortable with the technical aspects of programming and memory management.

47,"This page is a review of the Comprint Epson/Centronics interface, written by Chris Durham for Commodore User magazine.

The review begins with a headline and author's name.  The introduction states that Commodore users often have to purchase interface adaptors to use non-Commodore printers, and that the Comprint interface is specifically designed for a Commodore 64 and Epson or Epson-compatible dot matrix printers.  It's priced at £61.99.

The review body discusses the historical context of interfaces for non-Commodore printers, noting that they've been around for a while due to Commodore's non-standard serial communication method for printers.  It highlights the common standard for most cheap printers (Centronics parallel, with RS232 serial) and the increasing quality and value of newer Commodore printers.  The review emphasizes the need for interfaces that allow near letter quality (NLQ) dot-matrix printing.

A section titled ""Comprint - the hardware"" describes the interface's design.  It's designed to fit inside the Epson printer, with a single DIN-plug connecting it to the computer.  Crucially, it has two serial port sockets, allowing a second printer/plotter to be connected.

The page also includes a table (Table 1) listing various control codes, likely for the printer.  These codes are represented in square brackets and include colors (e.g., [WHT] for White), cursor movements, and other commands.

The page concludes with the standard magazine footer, including the page number (47) and the publication name (""Commodore User"").

The article begins by highlighting the wide range of educational software available for the Commodore 64, specifically mentioning Longman Software's offerings for various age groups, including younger children and those preparing for exams.  The author then dives into a detailed review of several programs.

**Specific Program Descriptions:**

* **Mathematics:** The review discusses the ""Maths pack"" programs, including Transform, Trig, Stats, and Odds.  It notes that the Transform program allows plotting and transforming figures, but criticizes the fixed scale and the awkward handling of positive/negative rotations.  The Stats program creates charts, and the Odds program covers probability.  The author also points out that the text scrolls slowly on the screen.

* **Physics:** The Physics programs, including Formulae, Circuits, Light, and Machine, are examined.  The author praises the Formulae program for allowing users to choose topics and rearrange equations, but criticizes a significant error in the acceleration equation example.  The Circuits program is described as useful for demonstrating Ohm's Law, but the author notes the slow scrolling text.  The Light program includes ray diagrams and tests, and the Machines program covers levers and pulleys, with the author finding the stone-throwing engine example engaging.

* **General Observations:** The article points out that while the programs are generally well-structured, some explanations are not very comprehensive and introduce new concepts abruptly.  The author also notes that some programs include lists of words related to a subject, but lack definitions, which might not be very useful for students.  The author also mentions that some programs include games to provide a break from the more academic content.

**Overall Assessment:**

The review is mixed. While the author acknowledges the programs' strengths, such as the visual aids and the opportunity to practice calculations, they also point out significant flaws, including errors in equations, slow scrolling text, and abrupt transitions between concepts.  The author suggests that the programs might be more suitable for students who already have a good grasp of the subject matter or for those who are looking for supplementary material rather than a complete course.

**Rating:**

There isn't an explicit numerical rating, but the review's tone suggests a mixed opinion.  While some aspects are praised, the author also points out significant shortcomings.
