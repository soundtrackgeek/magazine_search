32,"This is a page from a magazine, likely *Amiga Power*, featuring a review of a game called ""Odyssey.""

The page is dominated by a large, stylized image of a man, likely the protagonist of the game, in a fantasy-style setting.  Surrounding him are various creatures, including a jaguar, an eagle, a small spider, and other fantastical elements.
