The review, written by Nick Kelly, gives a detailed overview of the game's features, strengths, and weaknesses.

**Game Overview:**

The review highlights ""Top Landing"" as Taito's second attempt at a commercial aircraft simulator, improving upon its predecessor, ""Midnight Landing.""  The game involves taking off and landing at various airports, with the primary challenge being following the often-muffled instructions from the control tower.  The game's graphics are described as suitably representative of the airports, and the game attempts to capture the realism of different locations.

**Gameplay and Controls:**

The review emphasizes the importance of following the onscreen instructions and the control tower's audio cues.  The game's difficulty is described as increasing when landing at different airports, each with its own unique challenges.  The review notes that the game's sound, consisting of radio instructions, is often difficult to understand, particularly in the arcade setting.  The reviewer also points out that the game's difficulty is exacerbated by the lack of clear instructions, even onscreen messages, making it a hit-or-miss experience.

**Graphics and Sound:**

The graphics are described as suitably representative of the airports.  However, the sound, consisting of radio instructions, is a significant drawback, often being difficult to understand, especially in a noisy arcade environment.

**Review Rating:**

The review provides a numerical rating for various aspects of the game, including graphics (8), sound (2), toughness (7), endurance (6), and overall (6).

**Additional Notes:**

The review also mentions that the game's difficulty is comparable to a real-world pilot's experience, with the need for precise adjustments and the challenge of understanding often-crackly radio instructions.  The reviewer also notes that the game's difficulty is further compounded by the presence of other games in the arcade, which can make the control tower's instructions even harder to hear.

**Visual Elements:**

The page includes screenshots of the game's interface, showing the cockpit view, flight path indicators, and other game elements.  The screenshots provide a visual representation of the game's mechanics and the overall aesthetic.  The page also includes a flight pass graphic, showing the horizontal and vertical flight paths.

**Overall:**

The review concludes that while ""Top Landing"" attempts to capture the realism of flight simulation, its often-unclear radio instructions and the need for precise adjustments make it a hit-or-miss experience, particularly in an arcade setting.
